description: |
  This session explores strategies for writing robust and efficient end-to-end tests, focusing on stability and speed.  The speaker delves into the challenges of traditional unit testing and proposes an alternative approach using Cucumber and Gherkin to define system environments and preconditions.  The talk demonstrates how to leverage Pact to mock entire servers, ensuring reliable and predictable test outcomes, even with dynamic backend behavior.  Using a practical example of building a rock-paper-scissors game, the speaker illustrates how this method allows for comprehensive UI testing within a minute per test case, while maintaining high reliability.  The session also touches upon the importance of documenting business rules and functionalities through tests, reducing reliance on individual team members and mitigating the risks associated with legacy code.  Learn how to create more effective and maintainable tests that contribute to overall software quality and team collaboration.
