description: |
  Explore the world of Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG) AI and its application in building smarter search systems.  Jirachai Chansivanon, a Consulting Engineer at MongoDB, demonstrates how to create a RAG AI system using MongoDB and vector search to enable natural language queries.  Using the example of searching an anime database, he guides you through the process of data ingestion, embedding creation, and search implementation.  Learn how MongoDB Atlas's vector search capabilities simplify the development of applications that understand and respond to complex human language, making information retrieval more intuitive and efficient.  Discover how to leverage these techniques to build your own RAG AI applications.
