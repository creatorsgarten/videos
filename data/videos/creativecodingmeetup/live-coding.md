  Literature review of what current tool do people use for live coding music/visual. Will show the example from my previous little project from sound: TidalCycle, SuperCollider, PureData to Visual: Hydra.js, p5js, Veda(GLSL), and TouchDesigner and explain some little for each program detail + pros/cons.
