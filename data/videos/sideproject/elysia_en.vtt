00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.000
Hello Hello

2
00:00:03.000 --> 00:00:04.999
Sawasdee Krub!

3
00:00:05.000 --> 00:00:08.000
Okay, so...

4
00:00:08.000 --> 00:00:17.199
Okay, if you follow tech stack news on
YouTube channels like Theo or ThePrimeagen

5
00:00:17.200 --> 00:00:21.000
You may be familiar with this video.

6
00:00:21.000 --> 00:00:24.000
Hello Hello?

7
00:00:24.000 --> 00:00:30.000
About 2-3 days ago, someone made
a tech stack called the BETHStack.

8
00:00:30.000 --> 00:00:33.000
If you go on Twitter, quite a lot
of people know abut it.

9
00:00:33.000 --> 00:00:38.000
Part of that stack is Elysia.

10
00:00:38.000 --> 00:00:45.000
Elysia is a TypeScript web framework
that is designed to be fast.

11
00:00:45.000 --> 00:00:54.000
If anyone doesn't know, it is similar to
Express but it's like 17x faster.

12
00:00:54.000 --> 00:01:00.693
Similar code, but 17x faster.
The framework is written in TypeScript.

13
00:01:00.694 --> 00:01:08.325
Running it on multiple processes can yield
performance comparable to Rust's Actix,

14
00:01:08.326 --> 00:01:10.000
Go Fiber, or Gin.

15
00:01:10.000 --> 00:01:15.000
When it comes to TypeScript web server,
it is considered very fast.

16
00:01:15.000 --> 00:01:19.000
It's almost unbelievable, right?

17
00:01:19.000 --> 00:01:23.000
It is made possible by two things:

18
00:01:23.000 --> 00:01:27.000
The framework is designed
to be run on top of Bun.

19
00:01:27.000 --> 00:01:31.000
Bun is like a very fast JS runtime.

20
00:01:31.000 --> 00:01:33.356
It aims to be a drop-in Node alternative.

21
00:01:33.357 --> 00:01:40.000
It also leverages Static Code Analysis
and Dynamic Code Injection.

22
00:01:40.000 --> 00:01:44.816
It analyzes the endpoint's code and
dynamically generates code

23
00:01:44.817 --> 00:01:47.000
tailered to that endpoint
with low overhead.

24
00:01:47.000 --> 00:01:51.000
But today, I'm not going to talk about
why it's fast or why it's like this --

25
00:01:51.000 --> 00:01:54.004
I'm going to talk about
why people like Elysia

26
00:01:54.005 --> 00:01:56.000
and how is the developer experience.

27
00:01:56.000 --> 00:02:02.199
If anyone has ever written a backend, they
would know that to set up authentication

28
00:02:02.200 --> 00:02:05.000
it would take a fairly long time,

29
00:02:05.000 --> 00:02:07.000
like 2 hours, 3 hours.

30
00:02:07.000 --> 00:02:13.000
But in Elysia, now there is an
experimental project called Elysia Elf.

31
00:02:13.000 --> 00:02:19.000
It allows us to set up
Elysia project very easily.

32
00:02:19.000 --> 00:02:21.000
We just need to type in the command.

33
00:02:21.000 --> 00:02:23.000
Let's see how it works.

34
00:02:23.000 --> 00:02:27.000
Well, let me put the mic down and
increase the screen size a little bit.

35
00:02:31.000 --> 00:02:34.611
Okay, so to create an Elysia project,
we type in "bun create elysia"

36
00:02:34.612 --> 00:02:37.000
followed by the project name.

37
00:02:37.000 --> 00:02:39.000
I set the project name to 08.

38
00:02:43.000 --> 00:02:45.000
Ok, here's what happened.

39
00:02:45.000 --> 00:02:49.000
Once we run bun create,
it generates a project.

40
00:02:49.000 --> 00:02:51.000
We "cd" into the project.

41
00:02:51.000 --> 00:02:57.000
Let's look at the code, "src/index".

42
00:02:57.000 --> 00:02:59.000
This is an Elysia server.

43
00:02:59.000 --> 00:03:01.000
The main thing is that we type in the code.

44
00:03:01.000 --> 00:03:05.000
Okay, do dot get and then say that this method can do what.

45
00:03:05.000 --> 00:03:07.000
It's like xpress.

46
00:03:07.000 --> 00:03:09.000
Think of it like xpress.

47
00:03:09.000 --> 00:03:11.000
But we don't have a request.

48
00:03:11.000 --> 00:03:13.000
We just send the value back and it will be a server.

49
00:03:13.000 --> 00:03:17.000
Now, let's try to set up the authentication.

50
00:03:17.000 --> 00:03:23.000
First, we set up the restdit stack.

51
00:03:23.000 --> 00:03:25.000
Then we run the docker.

52
00:03:25.000 --> 00:03:27.000
Actually, it should have run already.

53
00:03:27.000 --> 00:03:29.000
Run the docker.

54
00:03:29.000 --> 00:03:31.000
Run the docker postgres to be the authentication.

55
00:03:31.000 --> 00:03:35.000
Here, you see that I just created a new project, right?

56
00:03:35.000 --> 00:03:37.000
Here, it will have an experimental one.

57
00:03:37.000 --> 00:03:41.000
If you have ever written Laravel or Ruby on Rails, it will have CLI for generating projects.

58
00:03:41.000 --> 00:03:45.000
Elysia also has it, the name is f.

59
00:03:45.000 --> 00:03:49.000
When we type in this command, I type in the word f add.

60
00:03:49.000 --> 00:03:51.000
This will be all the plugins that we can use.

61
00:03:51.000 --> 00:03:53.000
What do you want?

62
00:03:53.000 --> 00:03:55.000
For example, if you want to get GraphQL, want to get Strict plugin, want to get Swagger plugin, then enter.

63
00:03:55.000 --> 00:03:59.000
Then answer a few questions and it will be like.

64
00:03:59.000 --> 00:04:03.000
The host will update the back side.

65
00:04:03.000 --> 00:04:05.000
Hey, what plugins have we added?

66
00:04:05.000 --> 00:04:09.000
Then we add that we want to get GraphQL plugins.

67
00:04:09.000 --> 00:04:11.000
Then it will extend everything to all.

68
00:04:11.000 --> 00:04:13.000
Here, we will try to run the server first.

69
00:04:13.000 --> 00:04:15.000
Pnpmdata.

70
00:04:15.000 --> 00:04:17.000
Run server to port 3000.

71
00:04:17.000 --> 00:04:19.000
Go to localhost 3000.

72
00:04:19.000 --> 00:04:21.000
Swagger.

73
00:04:21.000 --> 00:04:23.000
It will have all the Swagger files.

74
00:04:23.000 --> 00:04:27.000
This is that we don't have to write the API itself to see what it wants.

75
00:04:27.000 --> 00:04:33.000
Here, the cool thing is that Elysia has a cheat.

76
00:04:33.000 --> 00:04:35.000
Suppose we want to get authentication.

77
00:04:35.000 --> 00:04:37.000
We type in elf generate auth.

78
00:04:37.000 --> 00:04:39.000
And say that we want to get ORM.

79
00:04:39.000 --> 00:04:41.000
I'll take Prisma.

80
00:04:41.000 --> 00:04:43.000
And save Redis for saving sessions.

81
00:04:43.000 --> 00:04:45.000
Here, if you have ever used it.

82
00:04:45.000 --> 00:04:47.000
If you use Prisma, it's like an ORM of TypeScript.

83
00:04:47.000 --> 00:04:49.000
It makes it possible to write code.

84
00:04:49.000 --> 00:04:51.000
It's very easy to manage with database.

85
00:04:51.000 --> 00:04:53.000
I take the database as a postcase.

86
00:04:53.000 --> 00:04:55.000
And set the URL to be something like this.

87
00:04:55.000 --> 00:04:57.000
Database URL.

88
00:04:57.000 --> 00:04:59.000
Do you want to migrate database?

89
00:04:59.000 --> 00:05:01.000
Yes.

90
00:05:01.000 --> 00:05:03.000
Here, the rest.

91
00:05:03.000 --> 00:05:05.000
This one will manage the data migration for all of these.

92
00:05:05.000 --> 00:05:07.000
And it will ask if I want to get OAuth provider.

93
00:05:07.000 --> 00:05:09.000
Just a moment.

94
00:05:09.000 --> 00:05:11.000
Wait a minute.

95
00:05:11.000 --> 00:05:13.000
Wait a minute.

96
00:05:13.000 --> 00:05:15.000
Postcase.

97
00:05:15.000 --> 00:05:17.000
And then.

98
00:05:17.000 --> 00:05:19.000
I forgot to migrate database.

99
00:05:19.000 --> 00:05:21.000
But it's okay.

100
00:05:21.000 --> 00:05:23.000
File location.

101
00:05:23.000 --> 00:05:25.000
Okay, all done.

102
00:05:25.000 --> 00:05:27.000
I just type this.

103
00:05:27.000 --> 00:05:29.000
And I run pnpm run dev.

104
00:05:29.000 --> 00:05:31.000
Go to swagger.

105
00:05:31.000 --> 00:05:33.000
There is an additional part.

106
00:05:33.000 --> 00:05:35.000
It's about authentication.

107
00:05:35.000 --> 00:05:37.000
All these libraries will come.

108
00:05:37.000 --> 00:05:39.000
It will create this file.

109
00:05:39.000 --> 00:05:41.000
Auth.ts

110
00:05:41.000 --> 00:05:43.000
src.js

111
00:05:43.000 --> 00:05:45.000
All of them.

112
00:05:45.000 --> 00:05:47.000
I will try to create a user.

113
00:05:47.000 --> 00:05:49.000
Take one as src.js

114
00:05:49.000 --> 00:05:51.000
and take it as src.js src.js src.js src.js

115
00:05:51.000 --> 00:05:53.000
src.js

116
00:05:53.000 --> 00:05:55.000
src.js src.js src.js src.js

117
00:05:55.000 --> 00:05:57.000
src.js src.js src.js

118
00:05:57.000 --> 00:05:59.000
src.js src.js

119
00:05:59.000 --> 00:06:01.000
Now I'm trying to do a sign in.

120
00:06:01.000 --> 00:06:03.000
Okay.

121
00:06:03.000 --> 00:06:05.000
Of course, swagger is quite useful.

122
00:06:05.000 --> 00:06:07.000
The timer is off.

123
00:06:07.000 --> 00:06:09.000
The concept is

124
00:06:09.000 --> 00:06:11.000
Elysia can do something called n2n type-shifting.

125
00:06:11.000 --> 00:06:17.000
If you have ever written in RPC, you can use the type in the server on Cayenne, right?

126
00:06:17.000 --> 00:06:21.000
Elysian can do it too, but it's less full.

127
00:06:21.000 --> 00:06:28.000
Suppose I have a server, I add a folder called identity.

128
00:06:28.000 --> 00:06:30.000
This is a project that has been set up.

129
00:06:30.000 --> 00:06:33.000
Let's say it's in normal JS and use it.

130
00:06:33.000 --> 00:06:36.000
It's an easy one, it's a normal JS project.

131
00:06:36.000 --> 00:06:40.000
But now we'll see that it imports the type from this server.

132
00:06:40.000 --> 00:06:43.000
The server will come from this type.

133
00:06:43.000 --> 00:06:51.000
I want it to add a type as a source.

134
00:06:51.000 --> 00:06:56.000
Type, add as source, index.ts

135
00:06:56.000 --> 00:07:00.000
And I said that I exported the type of this server.

136
00:07:00.000 --> 00:07:07.000
Export, type of app.

137
00:07:07.000 --> 00:07:10.000
I can use the type of this server.

138
00:07:10.000 --> 00:07:12.000
I can use it on Cayenne.

139
00:07:12.000 --> 00:07:19.000
And then I'll go back here and run it at identity.

140
00:07:19.000 --> 00:07:22.000
08 run server Elysian together.

141
00:07:22.000 --> 00:07:25.000
And then run the server in JS together.

142
00:07:25.000 --> 00:07:31.000
Go to localhost 3001.

143
00:07:31.000 --> 00:07:36.000
Okay, here you can see that we go to the server here.

144
00:07:36.000 --> 00:07:39.000
Okay, reload for a moment.

145
00:07:39.000 --> 00:07:41.000
And then go to this server.

146
00:07:41.000 --> 00:07:44.000
This server, this API comes from the type we imported from the server.

147
00:07:44.000 --> 00:07:46.000
And then enter into one function called identity.

148
00:07:46.000 --> 00:07:49.000
This one is like a trpc for connecting Cayenne to the server.

149
00:07:49.000 --> 00:07:51.000
By which we can type.

150
00:07:51.000 --> 00:07:54.000
For example, in the server, I said that I have an API.

151
00:07:54.000 --> 00:07:56.000
Index and auth, right?

152
00:07:56.000 --> 00:07:57.000
In auth, what is it?

153
00:07:57.000 --> 00:07:58.000
You can click and see it.

154
00:07:58.000 --> 00:08:00.000
And then say, if we want to sign in, right?

155
00:08:00.000 --> 00:08:01.000
And then call the post.

156
00:08:01.000 --> 00:08:05.000
And then say that there is a parameter that we can insert.

157
00:08:05.000 --> 00:08:06.000
Here, type save.

158
00:08:06.000 --> 00:08:08.000
And if there is a change in the server, the Cayenne will change as well.

159
00:08:08.000 --> 00:08:13.000
Here, I will try to create, let's say, create a new endpoint API.

160
00:08:13.000 --> 00:08:14.000
And see if there is any more.

161
00:08:14.000 --> 00:08:16.000
Now we have auth and index, right?

162
00:08:16.000 --> 00:08:19.000
Therefore, we will try to create another endpoint.

163
00:08:19.000 --> 00:08:20.000
Come up and see.

164
00:08:20.000 --> 00:08:21.000
It looks like this.

165
00:08:21.000 --> 00:08:23.000
I secretly have a point in case I can't keep up.

166
00:08:23.000 --> 00:08:25.000
Therefore, I keep this one.

167
00:08:25.000 --> 00:08:27.000
And then run, add method, check get.

168
00:08:27.000 --> 00:08:29.000
Go to the slash android slash skadi.

169
00:08:29.000 --> 00:08:31.000
And you will get this JSON back.

170
00:08:31.000 --> 00:08:32.000
Here we go to Cayenne again.

171
00:08:32.000 --> 00:08:34.000
We type the word API dot.

172
00:08:34.000 --> 00:08:35.000
You will see that it has an additional path.

173
00:08:35.000 --> 00:08:36.000
It's an android like just now.

174
00:08:36.000 --> 00:08:37.000
And then dot skadi.

175
00:08:37.000 --> 00:08:38.000
And then.

176
00:08:38.000 --> 00:08:39.000
This is the method that we want.

177
00:08:39.000 --> 00:08:40.000
Save.

178
00:08:40.000 --> 00:08:42.000
We take the mouse to the data.

179
00:08:42.000 --> 00:08:43.000
The mouse to where?

180
00:08:43.000 --> 00:08:44.000
Data.

181
00:08:44.000 --> 00:08:46.000
You will see that all types come from the server side.

182
00:08:46.000 --> 00:08:48.000
For example, I said that there is ID, there is a name, there is a type.

183
00:08:48.000 --> 00:08:50.000
All of these will be here.

184
00:08:50.000 --> 00:08:52.000
Therefore, I will try to run on this one.

185
00:08:52.000 --> 00:08:54.000
Save and run.

186
00:08:54.000 --> 00:08:56.000
OK, this one is a bit missing.

187
00:08:56.000 --> 00:08:57.000
The image is missing.

188
00:08:57.000 --> 00:08:59.000
Therefore, I will add the image in.

189
00:08:59.000 --> 00:09:02.000
We go to server Elysia.

190
00:09:02.000 --> 00:09:05.000
And then we type the word bun f add.

191
00:09:05.000 --> 00:09:07.000
To be static.

192
00:09:07.000 --> 00:09:09.000
static plugin

193
00:09:09.000 --> 00:09:11.000
add static plugin

194
00:09:11.000 --> 00:09:13.000
add folder

195
00:09:13.000 --> 00:09:15.000
of this

196
00:09:15.000 --> 00:09:17.000
go to public

197
00:09:17.000 --> 00:09:19.000
add image

198
00:09:19.000 --> 00:09:21.000
reveal in finder

199
00:09:21.000 --> 00:09:23.000
copy image

200
00:09:23.000 --> 00:09:25.000
and paste in here

201
00:09:25.000 --> 00:09:27.000
this is from API

202
00:09:27.000 --> 00:09:29.000
we call

203
00:09:29.000 --> 00:09:31.000
static plugin

204
00:09:31.000 --> 00:09:33.000
default is public folder

205
00:09:33.000 --> 00:09:35.000
try reload

206
00:09:35.000 --> 00:09:37.000
you will see

207
00:09:37.000 --> 00:09:39.000
what happen

208
00:09:39.000 --> 00:09:41.000
I forgot to run server

209
00:09:41.000 --> 00:09:43.000
go to

210
00:09:43.000 --> 00:09:45.000
server

211
00:09:45.000 --> 00:09:47.000
go to server

212
00:09:47.000 --> 00:09:49.000
run

213
00:09:49.000 --> 00:09:51.000
it will work

214
00:09:51.000 --> 00:09:53.000
ok

215
00:09:53.000 --> 00:09:55.000
another thing

216
00:09:55.000 --> 00:09:57.000
you can

217
00:09:57.000 --> 00:09:59.000
size in size out

218
00:09:59.000 --> 00:10:01.000
if you write in react

219
00:10:01.000 --> 00:10:03.000
you can do form authentication

220
00:10:03.000 --> 00:10:05.000
but

221
00:10:05.000 --> 00:10:07.000
in react query

222
00:10:07.000 --> 00:10:09.000
you can type

223
00:10:09.000 --> 00:10:11.000
any type

224
00:10:11.000 --> 00:10:13.000
that's all

225
00:10:13.000 --> 00:10:15.000
thank you

226
00:10:15.000 --> 00:10:17.000
let's clap

227
00:10:17.000 --> 00:10:19.000
yay
