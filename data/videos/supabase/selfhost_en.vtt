00:00:01.000 --> 00:00:08.000
Hello, everyone. I'm Pornpat from DevForward, a software engineer.

00:00:08.000 --> 00:00:13.000
Sorry for technical difficulties.

00:00:13.000 --> 00:00:15.000
Okay. Next slide.

00:00:15.000 --> 00:00:22.000
Okay. Usually, if you want to make a mobile application or desktop application, you have that note, right?

00:00:22.000 --> 00:00:25.000
In this case, it's a real project.

00:00:25.000 --> 00:00:27.000
So in this case, I use Flutter.

00:00:27.000 --> 00:00:31.000
The second thing you have to think about is the backend.

00:00:31.000 --> 00:00:32.000
You have to make some API.

00:00:32.000 --> 00:00:37.000
So Supabase may be the answer.

00:00:37.000 --> 00:00:39.000
Yeah, you prepare to use this one.

00:00:39.000 --> 00:00:47.000
The expectation is you have, you would like to request something via API from the database.

00:00:47.000 --> 00:00:49.000
But in this case, you have the legacy one.

00:00:49.000 --> 00:00:54.000
I mean, the legacy system, like a report system.

00:00:54.000 --> 00:00:55.000
Next slide, ครับ.

00:00:55.000 --> 00:01:01.000
This one is like a traditional module.

00:01:01.000 --> 00:01:08.000
Someone in the company made it a long time ago, and it's still useful.

00:01:08.000 --> 00:01:15.000
So in this case, this module already exists, but the new one is not yet.

00:01:15.000 --> 00:01:24.000
So I would like to use Supabase in this case.

00:01:24.000 --> 00:01:27.000
Yeah, yeah, yeah. In this case, yeah.

00:01:27.000 --> 00:01:31.000
So, some people think you can use this architecture.

00:01:31.000 --> 00:01:38.000
You mean, if you want, for example, master data, you request via the first API.

00:01:38.000 --> 00:01:47.000
And if you want to do some report or get the report file, you call the second API.

00:01:47.000 --> 00:01:53.000
You can do this, but for the authentication, privilege, you have to control about this.

00:01:53.000 --> 00:01:56.000
In this case, I try to merge them together.

00:01:56.000 --> 00:02:00.000
This one already runs on DirectAdmin.

00:02:00.000 --> 00:02:03.000
It is an existing system.

00:02:03.000 --> 00:02:10.000
So my solution is to merge two things together and set them to seamlessly work together.

00:02:10.000 --> 00:02:11.000
This is the point.

00:02:11.000 --> 00:02:13.000
So, next slide, ครับ.

00:02:13.000 --> 00:02:16.000
Okay, this one came to this picture.

00:02:16.000 --> 00:02:28.000
So, for a mobile application, desktop application, or whatever application, you can get the master data or other things via Supabase.

00:02:28.000 --> 00:02:35.000
And you can also make the edge function and call the edge function via Supabase.

00:02:35.000 --> 00:02:47.000
And you can use the Supabase features, like JWT authentication, as you know from the previous talk.

00:02:47.000 --> 00:02:54.000
And also, you can keep the legacy system behind the scenes.

00:02:54.000 --> 00:03:01.000
So to do this, we will set up a little bit.

00:03:01.000 --> 00:03:08.000
The first one, we have a server for the DirectAdmin already.

00:03:08.000 --> 00:03:15.000
So the two things we have to do are, first, install Docker into the DirectAdmin server.

00:03:15.000 --> 00:03:20.000
And also, you use Docker Compose to install Supabase.

00:03:20.000 --> 00:03:24.000
It's easy if you follow the steps on the website.

00:03:24.000 --> 00:03:26.000
Next, ครับ.

00:03:26.000 --> 00:03:29.000
Yeah, you have to do two things.

00:03:29.000 --> 00:03:33.000
Okay. This one I copied from the Supabase documentation.

00:03:33.000 --> 00:03:35.000
So you just follow this one.

00:03:35.000 --> 00:03:41.000
The first one, just go to your DirectAdmin server, I mean, your VM server.

00:03:41.000 --> 00:03:45.000
Then you clone the repo of Supabase.

00:03:45.000 --> 00:03:59.000
Second, you go to the Docker folder, you copy the environment file, and follow the documentation suggestions, for example, the private key.

00:03:59.000 --> 00:04:06.000
And the last two things, just Docker Compose pull and turn Docker up.

00:04:06.000 --> 00:04:08.000
Okay, next.

00:04:08.000 --> 00:04:20.000
From this point, you will get everything that Supabase can do via this, following this API.

00:04:20.000 --> 00:04:27.000
The dashboard, you can access via your IP and the port 8,000.

00:04:27.000 --> 00:04:30.000
You can access the dashboard.

00:04:30.000 --> 00:04:38.000
And another API, for example, the REST API for connecting to the database, authentication, storage, real-time.

00:04:38.000 --> 00:04:40.000
And also, the last one is function.

00:04:40.000 --> 00:04:54.000
If you write an edge function and put it into the Supabase volume, you can call the local function via Supabase API also.

00:04:54.000 --> 00:05:00.000
Okay. And this one is where DirectAdmin comes to help.

00:05:00.000 --> 00:05:06.000
Because DirectAdmin can control the config file.

00:05:06.000 --> 00:05:19.000
Because this one already exists, so I use DirectAdmin to modify nginx, that connects the Supabase API and DirectAdmin API.

00:05:19.000 --> 00:05:26.000
So this one is a script, but it's very simple.

00:05:26.000 --> 00:05:28.000
You just see the two things.

00:05:28.000 --> 00:05:34.000
The first thing, you just map the location of each API of Supabase.

00:05:34.000 --> 00:05:37.000
And then you forward everything to Kong.

00:05:37.000 --> 00:05:42.000
Kong is here, it's on the 8,000 port.

00:05:42.000 --> 00:05:43.000
So you do this.

00:05:43.000 --> 00:05:49.000
So it means you can call everything from the Supabase API already.

00:05:49.000 --> 00:05:52.000
But this one is especially for the legacy one.

00:05:52.000 --> 00:05:54.000
You just remap it a bit.

00:05:54.000 --> 00:05:57.000
Yeah. Next.

00:05:57.000 --> 00:06:00.000
Okay. So the big picture is here.

00:06:00.000 --> 00:06:04.000
Right. So, usually, DirectAdmin can control this one.

00:06:04.000 --> 00:06:06.000
It's very legacy.

00:06:06.000 --> 00:06:13.000
But it's very easy if you want to make a sub-website or sub-system.

00:06:13.000 --> 00:06:17.000
It's a very traditional one, a very traditional way.

00:06:17.000 --> 00:06:23.000
You can do this with a lot of traditional ones, as web hosting.

00:06:23.000 --> 00:06:30.000
But this one is the new one, that we connect previously.

00:06:30.000 --> 00:06:47.000
ครับ. Okay. Now, you can connect to Supabase with the domain name because basically Supabase provides only the IP address, you can access it via IP address.

00:06:47.000 --> 00:06:59.000
But when you configure it this way, you can connect Supabase via the domain because DirectAdmin will manage the domains, DNS and HTTPS.

00:06:59.000 --> 00:07:04.000
And also, it forwards everything to Supabase containers.

00:07:04.000 --> 00:07:09.000
So you can access it, and then you can see the dashboard here.

00:07:09.000 --> 00:07:10.000
And next.

00:07:10.000 --> 00:07:18.000
So, this one is an edge function because you want to call the report generator.

00:07:18.000 --> 00:07:21.000
It's a PDF file.

00:07:21.000 --> 00:07:26.000
But the PDF file should be behind the Supabase API.

00:07:26.000 --> 00:07:42.000
So in this one, we write a small script to receive the request via Supabase and then pass it to the legacy system.

00:07:42.000 --> 00:07:43.000
Like this.

00:07:43.000 --> 00:07:50.000
So this one is how you call the legacy one, normally.

00:07:50.000 --> 00:07:54.000
And then you pass, maybe the authorization header, to the legacy one.

00:07:54.000 --> 00:08:01.000
And then, if the legacy response is not 200, next slide, ครับ.

00:08:01.000 --> 00:08:07.000
You just pass everything back as the response.

00:08:07.000 --> 00:08:14.000
So in this way you can request the PDF file via Supabase API also.

00:08:14.000 --> 00:08:19.000
Everything looks like it's via Supabase.

00:08:19.000 --> 00:08:24.000
You cannot see the API behind the scenes.

00:08:24.000 --> 00:08:33.000
Okay. And this one is an application, or mobile application, that displays on the mobile or application.

00:08:33.000 --> 00:08:34.000
Yeah, the employee uses it.

00:08:34.000 --> 00:08:36.000
And then this one is the report.

00:08:36.000 --> 00:08:43.000
If you call the API for the mobile application, you will get the PDF file.

00:08:43.000 --> 00:08:51.000
And you don't need to care about the logic here because of the legacy system.

00:08:51.000 --> 00:08:56.000
You just pass the ID or information through it.

00:08:56.000 --> 00:08:59.000
Yeah. This is it.

00:08:59.000 --> 00:09:00.000
Thank you.
