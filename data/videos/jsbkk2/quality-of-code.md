  Developer tends to believe that there are such things as objectively good code and system design. There are things such as best practices that can apply to every system regardless of context. This belief, while not completely false, is not completely true. In this talk, I will bring you to explore a characteristic is objectively high quality code and system. We also going to explore a characteristic of subjectively high quality code and system. And by exploring these two side of spectrum, we can see why subjectivity matters and how much does it matter to code and design. Therefore, we can understand which kind of practices need to be adjusted based on context and what kind of practices ring true to any type of software.
