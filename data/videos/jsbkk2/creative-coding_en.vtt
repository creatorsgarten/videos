00:00:08.440 --> 00:00:11.040
Okay. Hi everyone.

00:00:12.840 --> 00:00:14.397
I'm super excited to be here.

00:00:14.480 --> 00:00:17.880
Thank you so much for joining my session.

00:00:18.320 --> 00:00:21.237
My name is Patt and I'm a content creator.

00:00:21.320 --> 00:00:23.919
I make creative coding content on YouTube

00:00:24.279 --> 00:00:31.276
and the mission of my channel is to inspire people

00:00:31.359 --> 00:00:34.879
to explore their creative potential through code.

00:00:35.559 --> 00:00:37.316
Today though, I'm going to be talking to you

00:00:37.399 --> 00:00:40.080
about the power of creative coding.

00:00:40.520 --> 00:00:41.397
But before we get there,

00:00:41.480 --> 00:00:44.719
I would like to ask you a quick question.

00:00:45.079 --> 00:00:48.599
What comes to mind when you think of the word coding?

00:00:48.920 --> 00:00:53.959
I'll give you a few seconds.

00:00:54.399 --> 00:00:56.440
Maybe it's writing a piece of code

00:00:56.760 --> 00:00:58.919
to tell the computer to do something.

00:01:00.600 --> 00:01:03.000
Maybe it's a person sitting at a desk

00:01:03.160 --> 00:01:05.517
trying to write this piece of instructions

00:01:05.600 --> 00:01:08.600
to create a functional software.

00:01:08.960 --> 00:01:12.197
Or maybe it is that very same person

00:01:12.280 --> 00:01:13.797
staring at a computer screen

00:01:13.880 --> 00:01:15.317
trying to figure out what is wrong

00:01:15.400 --> 00:01:17.676
with these piece of instructions.

00:01:17.759 --> 00:01:20.517
And these images don't really scream creativity

00:01:20.600 --> 00:01:23.639
or spark any joy, at least for me.

00:01:24.479 --> 00:01:27.720
Coding can feel like such a technical thing.

00:01:28.320 --> 00:01:30.797
And if this what you're feeling right now,

00:01:30.880 --> 00:01:32.600
in the next 25 minutes,

00:01:32.920 --> 00:01:35.637
I'm hoping to convince you that coding

00:01:35.720 --> 00:01:37.360
is not just a technical skill.

00:01:37.560 --> 00:01:41.477
In fact, it is a really good tool

00:01:41.560 --> 00:01:45.279
for creative expression.

00:01:45.479 --> 00:01:46.840
I'm going to be sharing with you

00:01:47.119 --> 00:01:49.440
my creative coding journey

00:01:49.880 --> 00:01:54.000
and how it has impacted my way of approach learning.

00:01:54.280 --> 00:01:56.557
Also, how it can foster a mindset

00:01:56.640 --> 00:01:59.200
of exploration and experimentation.

00:02:01.280 --> 00:02:05.000
Let's start with a little bit of a backstory.

00:02:05.280 --> 00:02:07.277
Back in 2010, that was when I first

00:02:07.360 --> 00:02:08.796
discovered programming.

00:02:08.879 --> 00:02:11.197
That was when I took an introductory class

00:02:11.280 --> 00:02:13.280
in programming called 15110.

00:02:14.400 --> 00:02:16.037
And I still remember this number

00:02:16.120 --> 00:02:18.516
because it was such a memorable experience,

00:02:18.599 --> 00:02:21.040
not in a good way, in a bad way.

00:02:21.800 --> 00:02:23.719
I was struggling so much in this class.

00:02:23.879 --> 00:02:26.557
I remember sitting in the class thinking that

00:02:26.640 --> 00:02:29.680
coding is such a cold, difficult thing.

00:02:30.120 --> 00:02:32.280
It is a skill that I needed to overcome,

00:02:32.560 --> 00:02:34.960
something that I wasn't really able to do.

00:02:35.800 --> 00:02:38.240
Coding was a series of problem to solve,

00:02:38.840 --> 00:02:40.837
something that was very difficult.

00:02:40.920 --> 00:02:43.400
But luckily and thankfully, I passed the class,

00:02:43.519 --> 00:02:44.439
but barely.

00:02:44.879 --> 00:02:47.640
But I wasn't drawn to take any more coding classes.

00:02:48.000 --> 00:02:50.960
I just thought that coding was just not for me.

00:02:51.800 --> 00:02:53.957
But a few years later, I stumbled upon this

00:02:54.040 --> 00:02:56.320
other class called Interactive Art

00:02:56.640 --> 00:02:58.719
and Computational Design.

00:02:59.159 --> 00:03:01.076
I was a mechanical engineering student

00:03:01.159 --> 00:03:04.600
and I was very interested in art and design.

00:03:05.120 --> 00:03:07.720
And so this name really intrigued me.

00:03:08.560 --> 00:03:10.400
I knew that it had to do with coding,

00:03:10.680 --> 00:03:12.236
but what is this Interactive Art

00:03:12.319 --> 00:03:14.560
and Computational Design all about?

00:03:14.920 --> 00:03:17.240
I was so curious, so I gave it a try.

00:03:17.799 --> 00:03:21.520
And this class flipped the script for me.

00:03:22.360 --> 00:03:24.557
One of the very first assignments

00:03:24.640 --> 00:03:26.117
that we had to do was to recreate

00:03:26.200 --> 00:03:27.880
this piece called Text Rain.

00:03:28.480 --> 00:03:32.156
We were tasked to make it using an open source

00:03:32.239 --> 00:03:35.119
Java application called Processing.

00:03:35.239 --> 00:03:37.197
So as you can see here, Text Rain is this

00:03:37.280 --> 00:03:40.040
now classic interactive art piece

00:03:40.360 --> 00:03:41.360
that is done back in 1999

00:03:43.720 --> 00:03:46.960
by Camille Utterback and Romy Achituv.

00:03:47.480 --> 00:03:48.277
And so as you can see,

00:03:48.360 --> 00:03:50.117
it's these random pieces of letters

00:03:50.200 --> 00:03:51.557
that are falling on the screen

00:03:51.640 --> 00:03:54.599
and then you as a viewer can interact with it.

00:03:55.439 --> 00:03:57.520
We were tasked to do the exact same thing,

00:03:57.640 --> 00:04:00.397
but instead of using random pieces of letter,

00:04:00.480 --> 00:04:03.360
you were supposed to use your name.

00:04:04.040 --> 00:04:05.800
And it was super fun.

00:04:06.560 --> 00:04:08.279
Was I struggle to code this?

00:04:08.560 --> 00:04:10.120
Probably and most likely,

00:04:10.439 --> 00:04:14.076
but I pushed through because I was so amazed

00:04:14.159 --> 00:04:15.960
by the final output.

00:04:16.400 --> 00:04:18.639
This is such a simple program,

00:04:18.919 --> 00:04:21.396
but it was so interactive and it was so fun,

00:04:21.479 --> 00:04:22.520
and I was hooked.

00:04:22.960 --> 00:04:25.400
So this was the very first assignment,

00:04:25.520 --> 00:04:27.237
but I was also doing other assignments

00:04:27.320 --> 00:04:28.239
for this class.

00:04:28.600 --> 00:04:30.396
This one using a face tracker

00:04:30.479 --> 00:04:33.479
to generate some random recipes.

00:04:33.919 --> 00:04:37.160
And as I smiled, then you get the recipe.

00:04:37.680 --> 00:04:39.840
And then this is another project that I did.

00:04:40.280 --> 00:04:41.956
I believe we were using the Kinect

00:04:42.039 --> 00:04:45.116
to track our body and then we use it

00:04:45.199 --> 00:04:47.640
to generate some piece of music.

00:04:48.240 --> 00:04:50.637
This class, along with all of these assignments,

00:04:50.720 --> 00:04:53.597
really opened my eyes to the creative potential

00:04:53.680 --> 00:04:55.280
of things that you can do with code.

00:04:55.759 --> 00:04:58.437
And it also showed me that if I got really good

00:04:58.520 --> 00:05:03.679
at coding, I can make all of these amazing things.

00:05:04.199 --> 00:05:08.200
Coding become less about overcoming challenges,

00:05:08.400 --> 00:05:11.319
but it became more about bringing ideas to life.

00:05:11.520 --> 00:05:15.120
And trust me, I had a lot of ideas.

00:05:15.720 --> 00:05:18.280
And so I started to brainstorm a bunch of ideas,

00:05:18.520 --> 00:05:21.400
starting with this first capstone project.

00:05:21.840 --> 00:05:24.680
So I named it Slices of Beijing.

00:05:25.120 --> 00:05:29.277
Back in 2013, I took a trip to Beijing with a group

00:05:29.360 --> 00:05:31.317
of friends and it was such a fun time,

00:05:31.400 --> 00:05:34.320
and so I wanted to document it in a memorable way.

00:05:35.000 --> 00:05:36.956
And as a mechanical engineering student,

00:05:37.039 --> 00:05:39.797
I wanted to create a project that doesn't only live

00:05:39.880 --> 00:05:40.720
on the screen,

00:05:41.000 --> 00:05:43.797
but has some of the physical component added to it.

00:05:43.880 --> 00:05:49.240
So I decided to make this interactive map.

00:05:50.000 --> 00:05:55.797
It's a project that explore the concept of physical

00:05:55.880 --> 00:05:58.997
installation, projection mapping, and interactivity.

00:05:59.080 --> 00:06:02.480
So the whole idea is to create these small pieces,

00:06:02.639 --> 00:06:04.440
small slices of the map,

00:06:04.880 --> 00:06:08.077
and then write a piece of software that can detect

00:06:08.160 --> 00:06:11.396
each specific piece and then illustrate some image

00:06:11.479 --> 00:06:12.720
and project onto it.

00:06:13.560 --> 00:06:16.839
But what makes this project more special for me

00:06:17.080 --> 00:06:20.520
was what I required to do to complete the project.

00:06:20.880 --> 00:06:23.159
Not only that I had to learn how to code,

00:06:23.280 --> 00:06:26.680
I also had to pick up a whole set of other skills.

00:06:27.120 --> 00:06:28.280
In terms of coding,

00:06:28.479 --> 00:06:31.836
I had to learn how to detect each specific piece

00:06:31.919 --> 00:06:33.800
and then project some image onto it.

00:06:34.560 --> 00:06:35.640
But at the same time,

00:06:35.759 --> 00:06:37.840
I had to learn how to use a laser cutter

00:06:38.000 --> 00:06:39.959
to create the physical elements.

00:06:40.319 --> 00:06:41.317
And on top of that,

00:06:41.400 --> 00:06:44.157
I learned the design side of things to create some

00:06:44.240 --> 00:06:46.997
illustrations that are aesthetics,

00:06:47.080 --> 00:06:48.200
but at the same time,

00:06:48.360 --> 00:06:50.077
present it in a way to my audience

00:06:50.160 --> 00:06:52.040
in a meaningful way.

00:06:52.800 --> 00:06:55.277
Code allows me to create all of this,

00:06:55.360 --> 00:06:58.759
but it was the idea that drove the project forward.

00:06:59.199 --> 00:07:03.236
Code just became a bridge between my imagination

00:07:03.319 --> 00:07:07.440
and the final output.

00:07:07.960 --> 00:07:09.037
So as you can see here,

00:07:09.120 --> 00:07:11.360
this project, Slices of Beijing,

00:07:11.720 --> 00:07:14.637
I had the final vision of what I wanted to make,

00:07:14.720 --> 00:07:17.037
and then I broke it down into little steps

00:07:17.120 --> 00:07:18.637
and then try to take those steps

00:07:18.720 --> 00:07:20.920
and complete the project.

00:07:21.280 --> 00:07:25.116
But what's amazing about reframing code as a medium

00:07:25.199 --> 00:07:26.956
to create something was that it allows me

00:07:27.039 --> 00:07:31.396
to approach learning how to code through the lens

00:07:31.479 --> 00:07:36.956
of exploration and experimentation.

00:07:37.039 --> 00:07:38.116
So by this point,

00:07:38.199 --> 00:07:42.360
it's been over a year since I started

00:07:42.639 --> 00:07:43.800
my YouTube channel.

00:07:44.240 --> 00:07:47.720
And I've made over a hundred coding tutorials.

00:07:48.000 --> 00:07:50.637
And one of the questions that people ask me

00:07:50.720 --> 00:07:52.080
the most is that,

00:07:52.680 --> 00:07:54.599
where do I get my ideas from?

00:07:55.199 --> 00:07:58.080
And I get my ideas from all sorts of places.

00:07:58.520 --> 00:08:01.640
I believe that clarity comes from taking action,

00:08:02.080 --> 00:08:05.680
and inspiration emerges from working on an idea.

00:08:06.360 --> 00:08:08.759
Let's take this project for example,

00:08:08.879 --> 00:08:10.440
the sound mini series.

00:08:10.560 --> 00:08:11.277
So by this point,

00:08:11.360 --> 00:08:13.956
I have made a bunch of different videos that ranges

00:08:14.039 --> 00:08:15.516
from all sorts of categories,

00:08:15.599 --> 00:08:19.676
from generative art to typography to interactivity.

00:08:19.759 --> 00:08:22.357
And so I was trying to find a new path

00:08:22.440 --> 00:08:23.479
for me to explore.

00:08:23.759 --> 00:08:26.200
And one of my subscribers emailed me and said,

00:08:26.720 --> 00:08:28.119
why don't you look into sound?

00:08:28.400 --> 00:08:29.199
And so I did.

00:08:30.240 --> 00:08:36.079
And so this is the first piece that I did.

00:08:36.839 --> 00:08:41.119
It's called Rotating Polygons.

00:08:41.479 --> 00:08:42.516
And as you can see here,

00:08:42.599 --> 00:08:45.159
this is just one shape of a polygon,

00:08:45.320 --> 00:08:48.560
but what it does is that I can create this piece,

00:08:48.720 --> 00:08:50.200
set it to a specific speed,

00:08:50.360 --> 00:08:51.919
and then let it play a musical,

00:08:52.080 --> 00:08:53.760
some sound as you can hear.

00:08:54.440 --> 00:08:56.120
But with this specific sketch,

00:08:56.440 --> 00:08:58.117
what I had to do was that I had to go

00:08:58.200 --> 00:09:01.037
on a different website to download all

00:09:01.120 --> 00:09:02.200
of the different notes,

00:09:02.440 --> 00:09:03.920
upload them onto the sketch,

00:09:04.040 --> 00:09:09.479
and then play this, and then write the software.

00:09:09.839 --> 00:09:13.717
And so it was fine,

00:09:13.800 --> 00:09:15.357
but then if I wanted to change it

00:09:15.440 --> 00:09:16.597
to a different octave,

00:09:16.680 --> 00:09:18.557
what I had to do was that I had to go back

00:09:18.640 --> 00:09:20.357
to that website again and download

00:09:20.440 --> 00:09:22.120
a whole set of musical notes.

00:09:22.600 --> 00:09:23.837
It was quite redundant,

00:09:23.920 --> 00:09:25.560
but I really didn't know a better way.

00:09:25.839 --> 00:09:28.040
And so I stuck with it for a few videos.

00:09:28.399 --> 00:09:31.480
But then I asked myself, there must be an easier way.

00:09:32.079 --> 00:09:37.277
And so I decided to look into the sound library

00:09:37.360 --> 00:09:39.200
within the JavaScript library that I use,

00:09:39.360 --> 00:09:41.839
and then I found this class called oscillator.

00:09:41.959 --> 00:09:43.876
And that's exactly what it allow me to do.

00:09:43.959 --> 00:09:46.077
It allow me to generate some musical notes

00:09:46.160 --> 00:09:47.440
in a much easier way,

00:09:47.560 --> 00:09:50.117
so I don't have to go through that hassle

00:09:50.200 --> 00:09:51.196
of going to the website,

00:09:51.279 --> 00:09:53.120
download the files, and do all that.

00:09:53.240 --> 00:09:54.517
And so I stuck with this technique

00:09:54.600 --> 00:09:56.040
for a few more videos.

00:09:56.240 --> 00:09:57.880
And then I was like, okay, Pat,

00:09:58.200 --> 00:10:02.680
what if you want to get some more sophisticated sound?

00:10:03.000 --> 00:10:04.677
And so I went back to the sound library

00:10:04.760 --> 00:10:06.000
and then looked some more.

00:10:06.279 --> 00:10:08.400
And then I found this class called ADSR,

00:10:09.000 --> 00:10:10.760
which allow me to do exactly that.

00:10:11.160 --> 00:10:12.957
It allows me to separate the notes

00:10:13.040 --> 00:10:14.560
into four different stages,

00:10:14.920 --> 00:10:16.996
and then just add a little bit more volume

00:10:17.079 --> 00:10:18.077
and stuff like that,

00:10:18.160 --> 00:10:21.120
and create some more sophistication to the sound.

00:10:21.640 --> 00:10:23.239
So the more I worked on the idea,

00:10:23.680 --> 00:10:25.717
the more I posed questions to myself,

00:10:25.800 --> 00:10:27.117
and then the more I discovered

00:10:27.200 --> 00:10:28.920
and I experimented with the idea.

00:10:31.120 --> 00:10:32.200
And by this point,

00:10:32.440 --> 00:10:34.080
I already made 11 videos,

00:10:34.360 --> 00:10:36.640
and I explore all of the different classes

00:10:36.880 --> 00:10:38.760
within the sound library.

00:10:39.200 --> 00:10:42.477
And I also added to some physical simulations,

00:10:42.560 --> 00:10:45.637
and this is actually one of my most proud sketch

00:10:45.720 --> 00:10:46.277
that I made.

00:10:46.360 --> 00:10:51.719
It's called Pendulum Wave.

00:10:52.399 --> 00:10:53.840
As a mechanical engineer,

00:10:54.000 --> 00:10:56.037
I really love this one that I can actually

00:10:56.120 --> 00:10:57.280
simulate it with code.

00:11:01.639 --> 00:11:04.480
And so, the Sound Money series is just one example

00:11:04.920 --> 00:11:08.917
of me allowing myself to let my curiosity lead

00:11:09.000 --> 00:11:09.679
the path.

00:11:10.120 --> 00:11:13.037
And time and time again, it leads me to some very

00:11:13.120 --> 00:11:17.439
interesting places.

00:11:17.959 --> 00:11:20.237
So as you can see from the different examples

00:11:20.320 --> 00:11:23.556
that I've shown you until now, creative coding

00:11:23.639 --> 00:11:25.520
is not only limited to one field.

00:11:26.000 --> 00:11:28.436
It actually transcends disciplines.

00:11:28.519 --> 00:11:31.717
Whether you're an artist, a designer, a musician,

00:11:31.800 --> 00:11:35.357
a scientist, creative coding can be an incredibly

00:11:35.440 --> 00:11:36.320
powerful tool.

00:11:36.800 --> 00:11:39.357
An artist can use it to create some dynamic,

00:11:39.440 --> 00:11:40.719
interactive piece of art.

00:11:41.240 --> 00:11:43.756
A musician can use it to be a visual

00:11:43.839 --> 00:11:45.200
representation of sound.

00:11:45.600 --> 00:11:48.117
Designer can explore using creative coding to

00:11:48.200 --> 00:11:50.996
create some nice graphics or animations.

00:11:51.079 --> 00:11:53.797
And a scientist can use it to visualize some

00:11:53.880 --> 00:11:56.880
pieces of data in a more digestible way.

00:11:59.720 --> 00:12:03.560
The fact that this is such an interdisciplinary

00:12:03.959 --> 00:12:07.637
thing is such a good aspect about creative coding

00:12:07.720 --> 00:12:10.196
because it opens up a whole new world of

00:12:10.279 --> 00:12:13.556
exploration and innovation, which is a skill

00:12:13.639 --> 00:12:17.759
that is valuable in any profession.

00:12:18.199 --> 00:12:22.440
But looking at approaching, learning how to code

00:12:22.560 --> 00:12:26.717
through the lens of this interdisciplinary can

00:12:26.800 --> 00:12:28.517
come with a set of challenges.

00:12:28.600 --> 00:12:32.400
And that is because you're constantly a beginner.

00:12:32.760 --> 00:12:35.477
Trying to work on an idea that combine a few or

00:12:35.560 --> 00:12:38.436
many different disciplines means that you're most

00:12:38.519 --> 00:12:42.436
likely are not an expert in any of them or all

00:12:42.519 --> 00:12:44.159
of them.

00:12:44.839 --> 00:12:46.797
And that means that you're faced with new

00:12:46.880 --> 00:12:49.759
challenges all the time, and that is not always

00:12:50.199 --> 00:12:50.599
easy.

00:12:51.199 --> 00:12:55.277
And so, how do I overcome the fear of starting

00:12:55.360 --> 00:12:56.079
something new?

00:12:56.839 --> 00:12:59.837
It's still a work in progress, but I try to do it

00:12:59.920 --> 00:13:03.840
so often that it becomes easy, or at least less

00:13:04.720 --> 00:13:05.440
difficult.

00:13:05.720 --> 00:13:09.239
You get better at the things that you do often.

00:13:09.839 --> 00:13:12.837
Things become easier because you also gain the

00:13:12.920 --> 00:13:15.960
confidence of your own skills and your ability

00:13:16.160 --> 00:13:17.880
to tackle new problems.

00:13:18.160 --> 00:13:18.480
Why?

00:13:18.880 --> 00:13:21.477
It is because you have tackled so many different

00:13:21.560 --> 00:13:25.160
kinds of problems successfully previously.

00:13:25.360 --> 00:13:29.360
And so your circle of competence and confidence

00:13:29.639 --> 00:13:31.760
grows over time.

00:13:32.440 --> 00:13:35.637
And I also treat learning new skills like playing

00:13:35.720 --> 00:13:37.120
a video game.

00:13:37.720 --> 00:13:39.996
When you play a video game and then your character

00:13:40.079 --> 00:13:42.000
dies, what do you say to yourself?

00:13:42.360 --> 00:13:44.720
Oh my god, I'm such a failure, and then you quit.

00:13:45.160 --> 00:13:46.837
No, you never do that.

00:13:46.920 --> 00:13:48.720
You hit the reset button.

00:13:48.839 --> 00:13:50.397
You figure out what you did wrong in the last

00:13:50.480 --> 00:13:52.920
round, and then you do it again and try a new

00:13:54.040 --> 00:13:54.680
strategy.

00:13:55.040 --> 00:13:58.277
And if you treat learning new skills like playing

00:13:58.360 --> 00:14:02.639
a video game, you look at obstacles instead of

00:14:02.880 --> 00:14:03.876
as setback.

00:14:03.959 --> 00:14:07.277
You're faced with obstacles, but instead of

00:14:07.360 --> 00:14:10.717
looking at them as setbacks, you actually look at

00:14:10.800 --> 00:14:14.637
them as data points that show you what direction

00:14:14.720 --> 00:14:16.719
to take next.

00:14:17.399 --> 00:14:20.037
And as you level up, you collect more coins, and

00:14:20.120 --> 00:14:23.316
in real life, you collect more experiences and

00:14:23.399 --> 00:14:28.160
you gain more confidence.

00:14:28.360 --> 00:14:30.676
You don't have to know everything from the start,

00:14:30.759 --> 00:14:34.996
but you really have to have the willingness to try

00:14:35.079 --> 00:14:39.357
new things, test things out, and just see what's

00:14:39.440 --> 00:14:41.520
going to happen.

00:14:42.040 --> 00:14:45.037
And as you view all of those setbacks as a key data

00:14:45.120 --> 00:14:46.640
point for what to do next,

00:14:46.759 --> 00:14:50.760
it always leads you somewhere good.

00:14:51.440 --> 00:14:53.477
So this is another project that I want to share

00:14:53.560 --> 00:14:58.517
with you that at first felt really difficult.

00:14:58.600 --> 00:15:01.200
But as I take the first step and then the next steps,

00:15:01.800 --> 00:15:03.999
I expanded my technical abilities,

00:15:04.120 --> 00:15:07.277
and it also shows me the new opportunities

00:15:07.360 --> 00:15:10.917
that this can create in that this can turn into

00:15:11.000 --> 00:15:12.880
something beautiful.

00:15:13.160 --> 00:15:18.196
So what this is is a data structure called

00:15:18.279 --> 00:15:19.876
the quadtree,

00:15:19.959 --> 00:15:23.360
that I use to optimize a flocking simulation.

00:15:23.560 --> 00:15:26.397
So what is a quadtree and what is a flocking

00:15:26.480 --> 00:15:27.360
simulation?

00:15:27.600 --> 00:15:29.116
A quadtree is a data structure.

00:15:29.199 --> 00:15:33.799
It's a way for you to organize some data

00:15:34.120 --> 00:15:38.037
by subdividing a space into subsections

00:15:38.120 --> 00:15:42.080
such that it is easy to locate and access some data.

00:15:42.519 --> 00:15:44.717
And then the flocking simulation that you can see here

00:15:44.800 --> 00:15:48.876
is a model that mimics the way a group of animals

00:15:48.959 --> 00:15:49.519
behave,

00:15:49.759 --> 00:15:54.039
like a school of fish or a flock of birds.

00:15:54.639 --> 00:15:56.717
And so the goal was for me to actually implement

00:15:56.800 --> 00:15:59.717
the quadtree data structure to optimize

00:15:59.800 --> 00:16:03.440
the flocking simulation so that it can run smoothly

00:16:03.600 --> 00:16:05.440
and efficiently.

00:16:05.560 --> 00:16:08.196
And this project is special for me for many reasons.

00:16:08.279 --> 00:16:11.717
The first one is because I started out with a very

00:16:11.800 --> 00:16:14.157
small circle of competence and confidence.

00:16:14.240 --> 00:16:15.756
I didn't know what a quadtree was.

00:16:15.839 --> 00:16:16.837
I didn't know how to code that,

00:16:16.920 --> 00:16:18.840
and I had no idea how to do it.

00:16:19.279 --> 00:16:20.517
But then I pushed through,

00:16:20.600 --> 00:16:21.597
and I just figured it out,

00:16:21.680 --> 00:16:23.559
and I made the first video.

00:16:24.079 --> 00:16:27.360
Then I tried to code the flocking simulation,

00:16:27.480 --> 00:16:28.840
and then that worked as well.

00:16:29.240 --> 00:16:33.079
Then my circle of competence and confidence grew.

00:16:33.759 --> 00:16:36.077
And then the next step that I took was to combine

00:16:36.160 --> 00:16:37.436
the two things together,

00:16:37.519 --> 00:16:38.920
and then I made the third video.

00:16:39.120 --> 00:16:41.120
And by just a span of two videos,

00:16:41.319 --> 00:16:45.316
this circle expanded significantly,

00:16:45.399 --> 00:16:48.639
and I was able to create this.

00:16:49.319 --> 00:16:50.920
But here's the kicker.

00:16:51.440 --> 00:16:54.676
Completing this project not only allows me to gain

00:16:54.759 --> 00:16:56.800
a new level of confidence,

00:16:57.000 --> 00:17:02.436
but it actually lets me discover something

00:17:02.519 --> 00:17:04.517
that I was scared to do for a long time,

00:17:04.600 --> 00:17:08.799
which is dive into the world of physical computing.

00:17:09.079 --> 00:17:11.836
I was also inspired by this project called

00:17:11.919 --> 00:17:13.080
Diffusion Choir,

00:17:13.439 --> 00:17:15.677
done back in 2016 by these firms,

00:17:15.760 --> 00:17:18.960
Sosolimited, Hypersonic, and Plebian Design.

00:17:19.240 --> 00:17:22.437
It's a physical installation that uses flocking

00:17:22.520 --> 00:17:28.279
simulation to control these 400 origami-like wings.

00:17:30.160 --> 00:17:32.917
And so physical computing is where hardware combines

00:17:33.000 --> 00:17:35.716
with software to create projects that are more

00:17:35.799 --> 00:17:40.120
tactile, dynamic, and grounded in the real world.

00:17:40.720 --> 00:17:42.757
And so this is the new direction that I'm about

00:17:42.840 --> 00:17:43.157
to take,

00:17:43.240 --> 00:17:44.840
and I'm very excited.

00:17:45.280 --> 00:17:46.319
Am I nervous?

00:17:46.679 --> 00:17:47.680
A little bit, yes,

00:17:48.080 --> 00:17:50.237
because it's super new to me,

00:17:50.320 --> 00:17:52.237
and there are going to be a lot more challenges

00:17:52.320 --> 00:17:53.200
that come my way,

00:17:53.559 --> 00:17:56.197
but I'm confident that I will be able to tackle

00:17:56.280 --> 00:17:57.559
these new challenges.

00:18:00.400 --> 00:18:03.120
Approaching learning how to code through the lens of

00:18:03.240 --> 00:18:06.760
curiosity, experimentation, and exploration

00:18:06.880 --> 00:18:08.959
not only boosts your confidence,

00:18:09.159 --> 00:18:12.397
but it also encourages you to think critically

00:18:12.480 --> 00:18:17.200
and to solve problems in a creative way.

00:18:20.520 --> 00:18:25.397
It's not just about following instructions.

00:18:25.480 --> 00:18:30.917
Creative coding allows you to break complex problems

00:18:31.000 --> 00:18:33.677
down into manageable steps and find creative

00:18:33.760 --> 00:18:34.480
solutions.

00:18:34.760 --> 00:18:36.117
And when you're faced with setbacks,

00:18:36.200 --> 00:18:38.596
just look at them as data points to figure out

00:18:38.679 --> 00:18:42.320
a new direction that you need to take the next step.

00:18:43.000 --> 00:18:45.317
And so, as we approach the end of the talk,

00:18:45.400 --> 00:18:48.557
I hope that I have at least convinced you that coding,

00:18:48.640 --> 00:18:49.757
or learning how to code,

00:18:49.840 --> 00:18:51.520
is just not a technical thing.

00:18:52.120 --> 00:18:56.437
It is a tool for creativity, exploration,

00:18:56.520 --> 00:18:58.040
and critical thinking.

00:19:00.840 --> 00:19:03.517
It is what allows you to turn your ideas into

00:19:03.600 --> 00:19:05.280
a reality.

00:19:05.720 --> 00:19:08.559
And that's exactly what I try to do with my channel.

00:19:08.919 --> 00:19:11.277
My goal is to help people unlock their creative

00:19:11.360 --> 00:19:12.760
potential through code.

00:19:13.039 --> 00:19:15.757
And so whether you want to build interactive art

00:19:15.840 --> 00:19:16.757
installation,

00:19:16.840 --> 00:19:20.599
or you want to experiment with code or new technology,

00:19:20.720 --> 00:19:23.600
or you want to integrate coding into your field,

00:19:24.120 --> 00:19:27.037
I invite you to join me into this journey

00:19:27.120 --> 00:19:28.277
of discovery.

00:19:28.360 --> 00:19:28.637
Thank you.

00:19:28.720 --> 00:19:33.320
Wow, thank you. Thank you. Wow.
