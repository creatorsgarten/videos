  Web Components have been around for more than 10 years. They should be one of the concepts we teach to young developers, but somehow, with the rise of promising JavaScript frameworks like Next.js, Nuxt.js, and various others, developing modern frontend applications with Web Components is still not widely known. In this talk, I want to show how we can develop modern JavaScript components with only native APIs that most browsers support. How they can be used with or inside most JavaScript frameworks without problems.
