  Web development has evolved from traditional request-response models to complex single-page applications (SPAs). While SPAs brought interactivity, they also introduced complexity and performance challenges. Enter "HTML over the Wire" - a return to simplicity with modern benefits. This talk looks at HTML-first techniques like LiveView, Hotwire, and HTMX. These tools are changing how we build web apps. We'll explore the key ideas behind this approach. You'll see how it uses basic web tech to create dynamic, responsive application. At the end of this talk, audience will learn: - The evolution from traditional web apps to SPAs, and why HTML over the Wire emerged - Core concepts and how they differ from SPA approaches - Real-world implementation examples - Performance benefits and potential drawbacks This talk is for everyone in web development. Experienced developers will find ways to simplify their work. Newcomers will learn efficient methods for building interactive apps. You'll gain insights into a powerful new approach to web development.
