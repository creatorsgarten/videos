  We designed our system with a hexagonal architecture in NestJS. Our database is MongoDB. But we don't want to hit MongoDB with every request. We want to use cached data from Redis without changing a lot of our hexagonal code. Finally, we chose a decorator to solve this problem. We have 2 decorators. 1. Cache decorator 2. Invalid cache decorator
