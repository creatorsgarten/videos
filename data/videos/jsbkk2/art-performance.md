  What happens when TypeScript takes the center stage in interactive art performances? This talk explores three of my art collaboration projects that pushes the boundaries of creative coding: an algorithmic Thai Khon dance performance, an AI-powered performance lecture on intelligences in Singapore, and audio-visual live-coding with assembly language. We'll uncover how TypeScript, Three.js, React, and WebAssembly can enrich stage performances. From generating dance moves in real-time to creating AI images on the fly, and even turning assembly code into a visual spectacle, you'll discover the exciting possibilities that emerge when we bring the power of TypeScript into the art theatre.
