00:00:00.120 --> 00:00:00.797
How do I say it?

00:00:00.880 --> 00:00:02.000
สวัสดีครับ

00:00:03.000 --> 00:00:06.520
Good afternoon and welcome.

00:00:07.000 --> 00:00:12.556
DevTools was really helpful in different areas of your

00:00:12.639 --> 00:00:13.439
workflows.

00:00:13.759 --> 00:00:16.199
I'm going to share a few tips with you today.

00:00:16.840 --> 00:00:18.160
Going to be fun, I hope.

00:00:20.359 --> 00:00:22.877
The format of the talk is, I'm going to present a bunch

00:00:22.960 --> 00:00:26.960
of tools, and then you see what fit your workflow.

00:00:27.920 --> 00:00:30.516
I will send the slide later on, so don't worry if you

00:00:30.599 --> 00:00:33.359
don't catch some of the tips.

00:00:33.680 --> 00:00:36.120
So with that, let's start.

00:00:36.960 --> 00:00:43.476
Sometimes, I believe, unsubscribe to a newsletter seems

00:00:43.559 --> 00:00:44.920
to be too easy.

00:00:46.520 --> 00:00:49.719
So you try to select a button, but it just won't, right?

00:00:50.559 --> 00:00:54.040
There's a little bit of trick behind it.

00:00:54.760 --> 00:00:57.796
And if you are a frontend engineer and you know how to

00:00:57.879 --> 00:01:02.000
use DevTools, I think that's where the magic coming in.

00:01:02.840 --> 00:01:05.597
So you can select the button and you say, "I want it to

00:01:05.680 --> 00:01:07.560
be a global variable."

00:01:07.840 --> 00:01:12.877
And you can trigger the click, programmatically.

00:01:12.960 --> 00:01:13.837
And then there's no cheating.

00:01:13.920 --> 00:01:14.317
Yeah, sorry.

00:01:14.400 --> 00:01:16.280
It's, of course, we know it's going to happen.

00:01:17.479 --> 00:01:20.117
So this kind of example remind me of what I built,

00:01:20.200 --> 00:01:21.320
probably, 10 years ago.

00:01:22.000 --> 00:01:26.477
I'm not sure if anyone of you built the same thing.

00:01:26.560 --> 00:01:30.036
By the way, I'm going to share the code for that, so you

00:01:30.119 --> 00:01:33.720
can use it for your future reference.

00:01:34.000 --> 00:01:38.036
But if your friend know how to use DevTools, then things

00:01:38.119 --> 00:01:40.320
going to be a little bit easy, I think.

00:01:41.119 --> 00:01:43.840
So now in DevTools, you can select the button.

00:01:44.280 --> 00:01:47.240
And then, okay, try to select a no button, very

00:01:47.439 --> 00:01:48.197
attention.

00:01:48.280 --> 00:01:50.480
And you can do $0.

00:01:52.040 --> 00:01:52.837
I try to select it.

00:01:52.920 --> 00:01:53.800
You go in and do $0.

00:01:55.479 --> 00:01:58.197
So it just select the current selected element, right?

00:01:58.280 --> 00:02:00.119
You don't need to do 𝚍𝚘𝚌𝚞𝚖𝚎𝚗𝚝.𝚐𝚎𝚝𝙴𝚕𝚎𝚖𝚎𝚗𝚝𝙱𝚢𝙸𝚍 or

00:02:00.280 --> 00:02:00.996
something.

00:02:01.079 --> 00:02:02.917
It just be able to select the button.

00:02:03.000 --> 00:02:04.920
But, yeah, of course, it's not working.

00:02:05.119 --> 00:02:06.359
We know it's going to happen.

00:02:08.520 --> 00:02:13.440
So I think, right, the web has been around for,

00:02:13.640 --> 00:02:17.076
probably, around 30 years since 1990 when Tim

00:02:17.159 --> 00:02:18.360
Berners-Lee introduced it.

00:02:18.840 --> 00:02:21.040
And the web has been going a long way.

00:02:21.200 --> 00:02:24.436
And, at the same time, the DevTools, the browser, which

00:02:24.519 --> 00:02:27.120
is what is serving the web, is also coming a long way.

00:02:27.840 --> 00:02:30.357
We got different tools from different vendors.

00:02:30.440 --> 00:02:31.840
There's Firefox, you see.

00:02:32.120 --> 00:02:34.559
There's something doesn't work.

00:02:35.239 --> 00:02:36.439
Okay, there's Chrome.

00:02:36.599 --> 00:02:38.400
That's mainly what we're looking to today.

00:02:38.840 --> 00:02:42.637
And also Safari, which is sometimes you need to look

00:02:42.720 --> 00:02:45.880
into it if you see a production issue on Safari.

00:02:46.360 --> 00:02:48.156
But likely, most of the time, you want to use DevTools

00:02:48.239 --> 00:02:49.519
of Chrome, anyway.

00:02:50.120 --> 00:02:54.236
So I try to look for the oldest version of Chrome

00:02:54.319 --> 00:02:55.559
DevTools I can find.

00:02:55.959 --> 00:02:58.076
So that is the version 15 Chrome.

00:02:58.159 --> 00:02:59.040
It's long time ago.

00:02:59.959 --> 00:03:01.960
And it's in 2011.

00:03:04.680 --> 00:03:07.397
If you zoom in a little bit, right, the DevTools that we

00:03:07.480 --> 00:03:11.280
have more than a decade ago look pretty similar.

00:03:11.480 --> 00:03:16.040
You still got elements, resources, network, script.

00:03:17.480 --> 00:03:20.360
And then comparing to what you have today, a lot

00:03:21.040 --> 00:03:24.757
simpler, in a way, but also packed so many more

00:03:24.840 --> 00:03:26.600
information comparing to 10 years ago.

00:03:26.879 --> 00:03:29.677
So today, we go a long way.

00:03:29.760 --> 00:03:32.839
So I try to show you some of that.

00:03:33.000 --> 00:03:37.436
And the fun fact is DevTools is the web application.

00:03:37.519 --> 00:03:39.720
And, probably, you can use DevTools to debug DevTools,

00:03:39.920 --> 00:03:42.716
but I never try it, and I don't know how it's going to

00:03:42.799 --> 00:03:43.037
work.

00:03:43.120 --> 00:03:45.677
But, technically speaking, it's possible.

00:03:45.760 --> 00:03:48.597
So you can go to GitHub and see how the component is

00:03:48.680 --> 00:03:49.080
built.

00:03:49.319 --> 00:03:52.917
It is very interesting to see how this kind of tooling

00:03:53.000 --> 00:03:54.639
was built from Google scale.

00:03:55.159 --> 00:03:57.597
And they have a lot of documentation.

00:03:57.680 --> 00:03:59.359
I think it's not on GitHub.

00:03:59.480 --> 00:04:01.959
It's in Google sources.

00:04:02.319 --> 00:04:05.200
But do feel free to take a look later on.

00:04:06.040 --> 00:04:10.479
So I think Addy was mentioning a good tool can make a

00:04:10.720 --> 00:04:13.560
difficult job easy and an easy job faster.

00:04:13.879 --> 00:04:17.637
So I think, definitely, DevTools was playing around in

00:04:17.720 --> 00:04:21.637
an important part in your workflow, whether to trying to

00:04:21.720 --> 00:04:25.797
unsubscribe newsletter, or, more importantly, on your

00:04:25.880 --> 00:04:30.200
daily workflow on actively doing local development.

00:04:30.479 --> 00:04:32.396
So where do we start?

00:04:32.479 --> 00:04:34.157
I think we start with something basic, right?

00:04:34.240 --> 00:04:37.320
I know everything early is basic, so stay with me.

00:04:37.600 --> 00:04:38.599
Don't leave the room.

00:04:39.479 --> 00:04:40.519
So we start with F12.

00:04:42.000 --> 00:04:43.437
That's the easiest you can do, right?

00:04:43.520 --> 00:04:45.600
You right-click, you do inspect.

00:04:45.960 --> 00:04:49.317
And then you do whatever thing you can do.

00:04:49.400 --> 00:04:51.880
There's console, or you can press F12.

00:04:52.639 --> 00:04:54.240
That's the shortcut.

00:04:54.600 --> 00:04:55.840
Super easy.

00:04:56.520 --> 00:04:57.280
I think that's all.

00:04:57.440 --> 00:04:59.519
That's basic.

00:05:00.400 --> 00:05:04.400
Next thing you can do, you can toggle the responsive

00:05:04.840 --> 00:05:08.400
window using shortcut, command+shift+M.

00:05:09.240 --> 00:05:12.877
If you are engineer, at the point of time, you just want

00:05:12.960 --> 00:05:14.560
to use keyboard for anything.

00:05:14.680 --> 00:05:16.637
So command+shift+M is not everyone using.

00:05:16.720 --> 00:05:19.997
You just click this icon on the top of this mobile.

00:05:20.080 --> 00:05:22.277
But do use it sometime.

00:05:22.360 --> 00:05:23.360
Quite helpful.

00:05:23.720 --> 00:05:26.640
And the last thing, not many people using is

00:05:26.840 --> 00:05:27.720
command+shift+P.

00:05:27.960 --> 00:05:30.079
Just open the command menu.

00:05:30.479 --> 00:05:32.800
And now there's so many things you can see from it.

00:05:33.039 --> 00:05:33.959
So do check it out.

00:05:34.680 --> 00:05:35.760
We only mention a few.

00:05:36.039 --> 00:05:36.720
Don't worry.

00:05:37.160 --> 00:05:39.959
But there's so many more that we can explore.

00:05:41.199 --> 00:05:42.956
So there's a lot more, right?

00:05:43.039 --> 00:05:45.199
So you can go to setting and go to shortcut.

00:05:45.479 --> 00:05:46.277
So many more.

00:05:46.360 --> 00:05:49.480
I couldn't really mention all of them.

00:05:50.160 --> 00:05:52.280
So, we're going to talk about a few things.

00:05:52.759 --> 00:05:55.960
There's console, the sources, and the network,

00:05:56.080 --> 00:05:57.640
and probably the last one is element.

00:05:57.840 --> 00:06:00.760
We'll see if we can do some live coding and all of that.

00:06:01.639 --> 00:06:05.840
But before we get into the detail, I'm Trung.

00:06:05.960 --> 00:06:08.956
I'm the Google Developer Expert in Angular.

00:06:09.039 --> 00:06:11.116
I've been running Angular Singapore and Vietnam,

00:06:11.199 --> 00:06:14.120
and I do speak at conferences here and there.

00:06:14.720 --> 00:06:16.516
In the past 10 years, I've been living in Singapore.

00:06:16.599 --> 00:06:18.240
I'm originally from Vietnam,

00:06:19.160 --> 00:06:22.160
but been calling Singapore home for past 10 years.

00:06:22.440 --> 00:06:23.317
Come and visit us.

00:06:23.400 --> 00:06:26.516
I believe Bangkok is one of the favorite destinations

00:06:26.599 --> 00:06:27.556
for people from Singapore.

00:06:27.639 --> 00:06:30.040
It's just so close, like two-hour flight.

00:06:30.720 --> 00:06:33.917
Things are affordable, great food, everything is great.

00:06:34.000 --> 00:06:36.639
So, do come visit Singapore as well.

00:06:37.319 --> 00:06:41.197
And I think personally, I got a lot of experience

00:06:41.280 --> 00:06:42.077
with Thailand before.

00:06:42.160 --> 00:06:46.357
That was me 10 years ago, more than that.

00:06:46.440 --> 00:06:49.960
I never thought that I would come back to be a speaker.

00:06:50.400 --> 00:06:51.917
I listen to a lot of Thai music.

00:06:52.000 --> 00:06:55.717
So, that's my favorite post-rock band, Inspirative.

00:06:55.800 --> 00:06:59.319
You know, anyone know? Oh, no, really? Okay.

00:06:59.639 --> 00:07:02.079
That's fine. We discover it later.

00:07:02.520 --> 00:07:04.796
And that's one of the dishes I tasted 10 years ago,

00:07:04.879 --> 00:07:05.760
still remember.

00:07:06.120 --> 00:07:07.999
But anyway, let's move on.

00:07:08.759 --> 00:07:11.360
And then last but not least, with Ascenda,

00:07:11.680 --> 00:07:14.240
we innovate toward loyalty program

00:07:14.360 --> 00:07:16.037
and try to make reward accessible.

00:07:16.120 --> 00:07:17.597
The company is based in Singapore,

00:07:17.680 --> 00:07:20.277
but we do hiring around the world.

00:07:20.360 --> 00:07:22.240
So, do check it out.

00:07:23.440 --> 00:07:27.477
So, I want to share the screen later,

00:07:27.560 --> 00:07:33.520
but for the purposes of the interest, all right, all good.

00:07:33.720 --> 00:07:35.399
So, here we look into console,

00:07:35.639 --> 00:07:40.116
and I think console is the most accessible tool

00:07:40.199 --> 00:07:43.399
that you can have in DevTools, I believe.

00:07:43.759 --> 00:07:46.839
And that's why it's everywhere.

00:07:47.039 --> 00:07:49.597
You will see at least one thing,

00:07:49.680 --> 00:07:53.037
one 𝚌𝚘𝚗𝚜𝚘𝚕𝚎.𝚕𝚘𝚐 from a production website here and there,

00:07:53.120 --> 00:07:54.599
definitely something.

00:07:54.879 --> 00:07:57.357
And that's the JSON card,

00:07:57.440 --> 00:07:58.757
that's the power of 𝚌𝚘𝚗𝚜𝚘𝚕𝚎.𝚕𝚘𝚐.

00:07:58.840 --> 00:08:01.560
It's going to take the thing and show in the console.

00:08:02.000 --> 00:08:03.597
But let's look into this example.

00:08:03.680 --> 00:08:06.759
I think it's hopefully Can you see at the end? All good?

00:08:07.360 --> 00:08:09.520
So, that's simple React component.

00:08:09.720 --> 00:08:11.680
They just a few properties.

00:08:11.960 --> 00:08:13.920
And likely, when you're debugging,

00:08:14.120 --> 00:08:15.880
you're going to do one thing, 𝚌𝚘𝚗𝚜𝚘𝚕𝚎.𝚕𝚘𝚐.

00:08:18.199 --> 00:08:21.836
If you don't do it, and of course, we are different,

00:08:21.919 --> 00:08:23.040
but I do it.

00:08:24.440 --> 00:08:26.877
So, that's what you get, simple.

00:08:26.960 --> 00:08:28.600
All right. Yeah, you get 𝚒𝚜𝙻𝚘𝚊𝚍𝚒𝚗𝚐,

00:08:29.039 --> 00:08:32.560
and you got 𝚙𝚕𝚊𝚢𝚕𝚒𝚜𝚝, pretty simple.

00:08:33.000 --> 00:08:35.400
And when you zoom in this line of code,

00:08:35.839 --> 00:08:37.557
so actually, you need to type a lot, right?

00:08:37.640 --> 00:08:39.999
𝚒𝚜𝙻𝚘𝚊𝚍𝚒𝚗𝚐, and then comma,

00:08:40.159 --> 00:08:42.080
and then whatever 𝚙𝚕𝚊𝚢𝚕𝚒𝚜𝚝.

00:08:42.360 --> 00:08:43.797
And then there's a shorter way.

00:08:43.880 --> 00:08:45.440
You just put it into an object.

00:08:45.640 --> 00:08:47.876
Because in JavaScript, when you do it this way,

00:08:47.959 --> 00:08:49.560
that 𝚒𝚜𝙻𝚘𝚊𝚍𝚒𝚗𝚐 becoming a key,

00:08:50.240 --> 00:08:51.876
and then 𝚙𝚕𝚊𝚢𝚕𝚒𝚜𝚝 also becoming a key,

00:08:51.959 --> 00:08:53.680
like becoming a playlist string.

00:08:54.120 --> 00:08:57.559
So, when you render it again, it's an object.

00:08:58.200 --> 00:09:00.799
Is it super helpful? I couldn't tell,

00:09:01.120 --> 00:09:03.316
but it helped me type faster, right?

00:09:03.399 --> 00:09:05.316
You're going to save a little bit of time every day.

00:09:05.399 --> 00:09:06.199
It's going to add up.

00:09:06.399 --> 00:09:10.320
So, do definitely try to use it bit more frequent.

00:09:10.680 --> 00:09:13.160
Many of my team doesn't use it, so I should encourage.

00:09:13.320 --> 00:09:17.559
The next thing is you can console thing

00:09:17.880 --> 00:09:19.280
without writing console,

00:09:19.560 --> 00:09:20.960
which is like blow your mind.

00:09:21.560 --> 00:09:24.120
Like, how do we Is it even working?

00:09:24.480 --> 00:09:26.759
I will try to show some demo later on

00:09:26.920 --> 00:09:29.316
when I don't have to hold the mic,

00:09:29.399 --> 00:09:31.399
but now we can just look into the screenshot.

00:09:31.519 --> 00:09:33.840
So, this one is probably very small.

00:09:34.360 --> 00:09:37.000
Can I have the stand?

00:09:37.720 --> 00:09:42.079
I think this one need to show you in the proper.

00:09:47.760 --> 00:09:48.800
All right, let's see.

00:09:49.240 --> 00:09:49.640
Okay.

00:09:50.240 --> 00:09:56.880
So, I want to stop sharing the rest.

00:09:57.800 --> 00:10:00.720
So, you can go to sources.

00:10:01.160 --> 00:10:02.637
I'm not sure if it's very small, right?

00:10:02.720 --> 00:10:03.599
Go to sources.

00:10:03.720 --> 00:10:04.557
Zoom in a bit.

00:10:04.640 --> 00:10:05.237
That's the one.

00:10:05.320 --> 00:10:07.840
That's what I'm trying to say.

00:10:08.600 --> 00:10:09.760
No worries, take your time.

00:10:10.600 --> 00:10:13.599
And then, when you are going into any line,

00:10:14.000 --> 00:10:14.996
you can right-click.

00:10:15.079 --> 00:10:16.359
That's right-click, okay?

00:10:16.560 --> 00:10:18.320
And there's something called add a logpoint.

00:10:19.040 --> 00:10:21.880
Do you know it?

00:10:22.720 --> 00:10:23.600
No one know it.

00:10:23.720 --> 00:10:24.840
No one raise hand.

00:10:26.000 --> 00:10:29.120
So, I can see that is why you are in this room.

00:10:31.279 --> 00:10:34.120
See, you right-click, you add logpoint.

00:10:35.240 --> 00:10:36.640
Okay, now let me zoom out a bit.

00:10:37.000 --> 00:10:38.000
Now it's too big.

00:10:39.560 --> 00:10:41.717
Okay, zoom in a bit and then you can do it slowly.

00:10:41.800 --> 00:10:45.957
So, it accept any expression, right?

00:10:46.040 --> 00:10:48.159
So, you can just do the same thing that we do just now.

00:10:48.600 --> 00:10:49.480
You press enter.

00:10:49.959 --> 00:10:54.240
So, now, okay, the zoom thing doesn't work very well.

00:10:55.320 --> 00:10:58.240
So, you see there's something on the left side.

00:10:58.920 --> 00:11:00.157
So, when you go to console again,

00:11:00.240 --> 00:11:01.920
let me just zoom in a bit.

00:11:02.680 --> 00:11:04.279
Hope it's still working.

00:11:04.639 --> 00:11:05.840
Okay, it doesn't seem to work.

00:11:06.720 --> 00:11:08.196
But it's not in the same component.

00:11:08.279 --> 00:11:10.080
So, I go to playlist.

00:11:10.440 --> 00:11:13.360
And it still doesn't work, really?

00:11:13.880 --> 00:11:16.756
That's what happened when you try to do live coding.

00:11:16.839 --> 00:11:17.840
Let me see again.

00:11:17.959 --> 00:11:20.917
Okay, I was in the wrong component.

00:11:21.000 --> 00:11:23.040
That's very unfortunate.

00:11:23.160 --> 00:11:23.996
But you get the idea.

00:11:24.079 --> 00:11:25.556
You go, I go to playlist listing.

00:11:25.639 --> 00:11:27.080
That's where I want, right?

00:11:27.200 --> 00:11:28.959
That is the line that you see just now.

00:11:30.200 --> 00:11:31.996
And then, I can do it again here, okay?

00:11:32.079 --> 00:11:34.679
Just below, anywhere below this line.

00:11:35.160 --> 00:11:39.277
So, I can do logpoint, okay?

00:11:39.360 --> 00:11:41.760
All good.

00:11:42.440 --> 00:11:43.998
All right, okay, slowly.

00:11:44.320 --> 00:11:47.237
Just to playlist.

00:11:47.320 --> 00:11:50.600
It's not my usual keyboard, so it's quite slow.

00:11:51.200 --> 00:11:53.320
You go back to console and now it should work.

00:11:54.000 --> 00:11:55.760
Yeah, now it should work, right?

00:11:56.360 --> 00:11:57.599
It's like magic, huh?

00:12:00.839 --> 00:12:05.316
So, okay, that's one of the logpoint.

00:12:05.399 --> 00:12:07.200
But it is super useful, I think.

00:12:08.399 --> 00:12:11.196
The reason why it is so helpful because if you put

00:12:11.279 --> 00:12:14.556
console on your code, when you commit something,

00:12:14.639 --> 00:12:17.720
you might forget to remove it from your code.

00:12:18.000 --> 00:12:21.120
So, that's why maybe you need to have force push

00:12:21.440 --> 00:12:22.677
to remove the console.

00:12:22.760 --> 00:12:25.517
So, you need to do something local, right?

00:12:25.600 --> 00:12:27.440
And then, you have the source map anyway.

00:12:27.720 --> 00:12:30.879
You can see anything in this source tab.

00:12:31.360 --> 00:12:33.599
So, do try using it a lot more.

00:12:34.199 --> 00:12:35.439
So, back to the slide.

00:12:35.880 --> 00:12:37.677
It's still presenting.

00:12:37.760 --> 00:12:40.477
Okay, now I need to go through, right?

00:12:40.560 --> 00:12:42.319
Of course, it's easier to see.

00:12:43.079 --> 00:12:48.720
The next thing you can do, you can change

00:12:49.360 --> 00:12:52.159
the program behavior on the fly.

00:12:52.519 --> 00:12:55.237
Because think about when you deploy code to prod

00:12:55.320 --> 00:12:57.200
or staging environment.

00:12:57.320 --> 00:12:59.316
Sometimes you want to test it out with

00:12:59.399 --> 00:13:00.717
a different value, right?

00:13:00.800 --> 00:13:02.640
There's a component.

00:13:02.920 --> 00:13:04.116
Let's say this component.

00:13:04.199 --> 00:13:06.640
I hope I can, okay, let's go back to the code.

00:13:06.959 --> 00:13:08.480
I think showing the code is easier.

00:13:08.760 --> 00:13:11.680
It's a lot more interactive.

00:13:11.800 --> 00:13:18.319
So, here, let's say I got this code, like, locale.

00:13:18.839 --> 00:13:21.040
It is going to come from a hook somewhere.

00:13:21.199 --> 00:13:23.277
And in a lot of use cases, you are not controlling

00:13:23.360 --> 00:13:24.080
of the value.

00:13:24.600 --> 00:13:27.677
And assuming you deploy the code to staging, right?

00:13:27.760 --> 00:13:29.759
You want to test it out with different value.

00:13:31.040 --> 00:13:33.959
So, that's the thing you see here below, right?

00:13:34.959 --> 00:13:35.917
That's the locale.

00:13:36.000 --> 00:13:38.599
So, you are try to do the same thing we did just now.

00:13:39.279 --> 00:13:41.600
I can see locale.

00:13:42.360 --> 00:13:43.637
And then, I go to console.

00:13:43.720 --> 00:13:47.359
Okay, let me, okay, that's too small.

00:13:49.320 --> 00:13:50.760
Up, down.

00:13:51.360 --> 00:13:53.720
Down, refresh.

00:13:54.800 --> 00:13:55.200
Sorry.

00:13:55.800 --> 00:13:59.640
Too small, but now the code is en-SG.

00:14:00.959 --> 00:14:08.357
And then, you want to try with, let's say…

00:14:08.440 --> 00:14:10.157
Let me remove this first.

00:14:10.240 --> 00:14:11.080
I add again.

00:14:11.240 --> 00:14:16.480
So now you got a new thing called add conditional breakpoint.

00:14:16.920 --> 00:14:18.400
Anyone knows it?

00:14:19.240 --> 00:14:20.839
Just to confirm.

00:14:21.759 --> 00:14:24.116
So this add conditional breakpoint is like it's going to

00:14:24.199 --> 00:14:28.597
stop the program when a certain condition evaluate in

00:14:28.680 --> 00:14:30.120
value true.

00:14:31.079 --> 00:14:33.797
So you can use it to run some assignment, right?

00:14:33.880 --> 00:14:37.357
So let's say you want to say I want locale to be some

00:14:37.440 --> 00:14:38.200
other value.

00:14:38.759 --> 00:14:39.680
You can use it.

00:14:40.800 --> 00:14:42.239
Now it's too big again.

00:14:42.399 --> 00:14:47.520
So I can say locale to TH, to Thai, right?

00:14:47.720 --> 00:14:49.359
I press enter.

00:14:49.959 --> 00:14:51.917
I refresh again.

00:14:52.000 --> 00:14:55.077
So now it's paused the execution because when you

00:14:55.160 --> 00:14:58.996
assigning something, the expression is going to return

00:14:59.079 --> 00:14:59.797
this value.

00:14:59.880 --> 00:15:02.996
So it is always be true if you assigning to something

00:15:03.079 --> 00:15:04.999
like a truthy value.

00:15:05.639 --> 00:15:08.320
So if I run F8, just let it run.

00:15:08.920 --> 00:15:10.880
You can see that now it changed to Thai.

00:15:11.560 --> 00:15:16.160
Even though the value of the hook is still en-SG,

00:15:16.920 --> 00:15:19.717
but you change the behavior of the program.

00:15:19.800 --> 00:15:23.239
It helps you to try a lot of fun stuff when you like

00:15:23.800 --> 00:15:28.236
do a payment on e-commerce website, you can assign some

00:15:28.319 --> 00:15:29.277
value, things like that.

00:15:29.360 --> 00:15:32.436
Anyway, it's not the purpose of this talk, but this one

00:15:32.519 --> 00:15:35.876
is super helpful on debugging, I believe, right?

00:15:35.959 --> 00:15:38.876
Sometimes you really want to do it, but you just don't

00:15:38.959 --> 00:15:39.599
have the tool.

00:15:40.480 --> 00:15:44.876
So the pro tip is like because now if I refresh again,

00:15:44.959 --> 00:15:47.119
you see it paused execution.

00:15:47.319 --> 00:15:48.439
But you might not want it.

00:15:49.079 --> 00:15:51.277
Maybe there's like the component re-renders like 10 times,

00:15:51.360 --> 00:15:52.679
it's going to pause 10 times.

00:15:52.880 --> 00:15:53.800
It's not going to work.

00:15:54.600 --> 00:15:59.037
So you want to do something like in JavaScript,

00:15:59.120 --> 00:16:01.760
we call it a comma operator.

00:16:02.120 --> 00:16:06.919
So you do this thing locale and you do comma false.

00:16:07.519 --> 00:16:10.436
What it does is like doesn't matter what is the thing

00:16:10.519 --> 00:16:14.236
on the left side of the comma, it is always returned

00:16:14.319 --> 00:16:16.760
to the value of the second on the right side,

00:16:17.000 --> 00:16:18.080
which is always false.

00:16:18.440 --> 00:16:20.837
So you run something and you just let it run.

00:16:20.920 --> 00:16:24.200
It will not stop here because it's not true, right?

00:16:24.560 --> 00:16:29.559
The value, the function say add conditional breakpoint.

00:16:29.920 --> 00:16:31.919
So if it's not true, it will not stop.

00:16:32.680 --> 00:16:37.559
So if I do it again, press, it just go.

00:16:38.240 --> 00:16:42.797
And then the value is still Thailand, right?

00:16:42.880 --> 00:16:44.797
You want to see is real.

00:16:44.880 --> 00:16:47.517
So if I wanted to see, I never tested out.

00:16:47.600 --> 00:16:48.517
Is it French?

00:16:48.600 --> 00:16:52.157
Is it No. DE?

00:16:52.240 --> 00:16:53.000
I'm not sure.

00:16:53.279 --> 00:16:55.639
Let's try.

00:16:56.399 --> 00:16:57.440
Oh yeah, see, it's working.

00:16:57.600 --> 00:16:58.436
Oktober, right?

00:16:58.519 --> 00:17:00.679
So sometimes you want to do it.

00:17:01.160 --> 00:17:08.716
Sometimes it's really helpful to get this functionality,

00:17:08.799 --> 00:17:09.277
right?

00:17:09.360 --> 00:17:09.476
Okay.

00:17:09.559 --> 00:17:12.517
All of this is just some slide I prepare in case

00:17:12.600 --> 00:17:13.996
I couldn't do.

00:17:14.079 --> 00:17:20.317
So that's that's a comma operator I just mentioned.

00:17:20.400 --> 00:17:23.319
When you run that, it just evaluate in the value.

00:17:23.640 --> 00:17:25.200
So it's going to be truthy.

00:17:26.280 --> 00:17:28.799
So do it with comma false.

00:17:29.120 --> 00:17:31.600
That is going to skip this breakpoint.

00:17:33.280 --> 00:17:33.997
All right, next thing.

00:17:34.080 --> 00:17:35.760
Anyone know about 𝚌𝚘𝚗𝚜𝚘𝚕𝚎.𝚍𝚒𝚛 does?

00:17:38.080 --> 00:17:39.360
I think I'm in the right room.

00:17:40.200 --> 00:17:40.917
We are in the right room.

00:17:41.000 --> 00:17:42.400
So just stay until the end.

00:17:44.000 --> 00:17:47.437
So it basically... So, okay, this one we can just see

00:17:47.520 --> 00:17:48.720
the slide, easier.

00:17:49.039 --> 00:17:53.720
So in React, you likely is going to...

00:17:56.039 --> 00:17:58.639
You're going to have the reference somewhere.

00:17:59.559 --> 00:18:02.836
And then you're going to assign it to HTML, right?

00:18:02.919 --> 00:18:03.400
A ref.

00:18:04.039 --> 00:18:05.716
And you want to do two things, right?

00:18:05.799 --> 00:18:09.279
You want to do 𝚌𝚘𝚗𝚜𝚘𝚕𝚎.𝚕𝚘𝚐 for this ref.

00:18:10.039 --> 00:18:12.680
We want to see in the next slide, but we see the value.

00:18:13.039 --> 00:18:16.277
So if you do when you click button, it's going to show

00:18:16.360 --> 00:18:17.117
you something.

00:18:17.200 --> 00:18:20.760
So the 𝚌𝚘𝚗𝚜𝚘𝚕𝚎.𝚕𝚘𝚐 is going to show you the first line.

00:18:21.360 --> 00:18:22.200
It's kind of useless.

00:18:22.799 --> 00:18:24.037
It's a beautiful version.

00:18:24.120 --> 00:18:26.359
It's like that's the element for you.

00:18:27.039 --> 00:18:29.037
But it's not something you interested in in most

00:18:29.120 --> 00:18:29.920
of the cases.

00:18:30.360 --> 00:18:34.399
You want the JavaScript DOM object to interact with it.

00:18:34.679 --> 00:18:38.117
So that is the only use case I found 𝚌𝚘𝚗𝚜𝚘𝚕𝚎.𝚍𝚒𝚛 is

00:18:38.200 --> 00:18:41.040
helpful because it's going to list down all of the

00:18:41.159 --> 00:18:45.237
property without beautifying it in kind of the first

00:18:45.320 --> 00:18:46.359
line, I can see.

00:18:47.080 --> 00:18:50.557
So it's helpful sometimes, not all the time, but at

00:18:50.640 --> 00:18:54.079
least it's something to take note of.

00:18:54.919 --> 00:18:57.200
And next one is 𝚌𝚘𝚗𝚜𝚘𝚕𝚎.𝚝𝚒𝚖𝚎 and 𝚝𝚒𝚖𝚎𝙴𝚗𝚍.

00:18:57.640 --> 00:19:00.076
It's basically to measure the time when you run

00:19:00.159 --> 00:19:01.877
a function, right?

00:19:01.960 --> 00:19:10.920
So here, I got a very... I don't know, it's a slow

00:19:11.039 --> 00:19:11.759
function.

00:19:11.880 --> 00:19:14.797
Doesn't do anything, it just keep trying to add up

00:19:14.880 --> 00:19:17.840
a sum until a billion.

00:19:18.440 --> 00:19:20.917
Of course, it's not a real worst scenario, but there

00:19:21.000 --> 00:19:24.080
could be use cases it's going to take that long, right?

00:19:24.240 --> 00:19:26.920
And you want to take like measure how long it takes.

00:19:27.240 --> 00:19:30.357
You can use like performance tooling and things like

00:19:30.440 --> 00:19:33.596
that, but it's a bit complicated for sure, like on

00:19:33.679 --> 00:19:37.076
this diagram, it's just might be blowing anyway.

00:19:37.159 --> 00:19:41.197
So sometimes you just want to see how long this function

00:19:41.280 --> 00:19:42.040
is going to run.

00:19:42.720 --> 00:19:45.160
And you say 𝚌𝚘𝚗𝚜𝚘𝚕𝚎.𝚝𝚒𝚖𝚎 to start this.

00:19:45.559 --> 00:19:48.880
And you do 𝚝𝚒𝚖𝚎𝙴𝚗𝚍, the same string, right?

00:19:49.159 --> 00:19:52.320
The two strings need to be the same, exactly the same.

00:19:53.000 --> 00:19:55.480
And then you see how long it's going to take.

00:19:55.640 --> 00:19:58.680
And in this case, you can see that it takes almost

00:19:58.880 --> 00:20:01.400
a second, which is really slow.

00:20:02.000 --> 00:20:04.640
Like when you try to click a button and this thing run,

00:20:05.159 --> 00:20:06.397
it's blocking everything.

00:20:06.480 --> 00:20:07.596
Like you couldn't really do anything.

00:20:07.679 --> 00:20:10.199
You click elsewhere, it doesn't work.

00:20:10.559 --> 00:20:12.760
So that is helpful when you try to debug.

00:20:13.280 --> 00:20:16.279
And I think let me try if I can show you the async

00:20:20.760 --> 00:20:21.320
version.

00:20:22.440 --> 00:20:23.679
Okay, it's working.

00:20:24.039 --> 00:20:27.520
The synchronous version seems to be very straightforward.

00:20:30.000 --> 00:20:36.039
But let's see if we can show debugging.

00:20:36.760 --> 00:20:38.277
So I get two functions, right?

00:20:38.360 --> 00:20:41.640
There's a slow thing, it just does it blocking way.

00:20:41.960 --> 00:20:47.280
For add some slow async, I'm going to create a promise,

00:20:47.720 --> 00:20:51.080
which means it's going to finish later in the future.

00:20:51.640 --> 00:20:56.680
So when I click a button, then I do the same thing

00:20:57.159 --> 00:20:58.760
without await, then it's not going to work.

00:21:03.000 --> 00:21:03.840
Let me remove await and async.

00:21:04.240 --> 00:21:05.320
Let me click again.

00:21:05.600 --> 00:21:07.879
So async is really fast.

00:21:08.559 --> 00:21:12.157
But because it's not really the time to finish

00:21:12.240 --> 00:21:14.757
the promise, it's just the time to call the function

00:21:14.840 --> 00:21:15.596
itself, right?

00:21:15.679 --> 00:21:18.117
So it's not what you want, and in a lot of use cases,

00:21:18.200 --> 00:21:19.359
you want to wrap it with async.

00:21:19.640 --> 00:21:22.720
And then inside, you just want to do await, like,

00:21:22.840 --> 00:21:25.279
to wait until it is ended.

00:21:25.799 --> 00:21:29.959
So now we do again.

00:21:30.880 --> 00:21:31.717
Zoom a bit more.

00:21:31.800 --> 00:21:32.677
A bit more.

00:21:32.760 --> 00:21:33.076
Okay.

00:21:33.159 --> 00:21:33.642
Easy.

00:21:34.720 --> 00:21:35.720
Time, timeEnd, async.

00:21:36.320 --> 00:21:37.959
Then go back, click.

00:21:38.720 --> 00:21:39.997
Like I said, it's very long, right?

00:21:40.080 --> 00:21:40.877
Almost a second.

00:21:40.960 --> 00:21:42.917
So that's how you do it with async function,

00:21:43.000 --> 00:21:49.520
you need to wait for it to run to get accurate time.

00:21:50.360 --> 00:21:54.399
The next one, I think we can just see the slide,

00:21:54.600 --> 00:21:55.880
console.table.

00:21:56.480 --> 00:21:57.480
Not very useful.

00:21:58.000 --> 00:22:00.200
It just displays things in table format.

00:22:00.640 --> 00:22:03.836
Sometimes useful though, maybe you have just two,

00:22:03.919 --> 00:22:05.997
three properties, and you wanted to compare them,

00:22:06.080 --> 00:22:07.960
but just good to know.

00:22:08.640 --> 00:22:09.956
Next thing is more interesting,

00:22:10.039 --> 00:22:13.600
I think it's utility building with Chrome.

00:22:14.120 --> 00:22:17.962
Where usually you need to do 𝚍𝚘𝚌𝚞𝚖𝚎𝚗𝚝.𝚚𝚞𝚎𝚛𝚢𝚂𝚎𝚕𝚎𝚌𝚝𝚘𝚛,

00:22:18.279 --> 00:22:20.599
and now you just do dollar sign,

00:22:21.600 --> 00:22:25.479
inspired by jQuery, absolutely.

00:22:25.679 --> 00:22:29.920
So maybe we should, in the code, easier again.

00:22:31.440 --> 00:22:31.840
Okay.

00:22:32.159 --> 00:22:33.800
It's working.

00:22:34.240 --> 00:22:39.880
So if I go back to the code and I go to playlist.

00:22:40.240 --> 00:22:40.637
Right?

00:22:40.720 --> 00:22:41.840
I select.

00:22:42.360 --> 00:22:43.800
Oh, it's very tricky.

00:22:44.320 --> 00:22:45.917
A bit tricky to show it on the code because

00:22:46.000 --> 00:22:46.879
everything is so big.

00:22:47.120 --> 00:22:51.759
So let's say I select this element on the element panel.

00:22:52.120 --> 00:22:54.000
You go to console, $0.

00:22:55.360 --> 00:22:55.799
That's it.

00:22:56.080 --> 00:22:58.037
That is the current selected element.

00:22:58.120 --> 00:22:59.679
You don't need to do anything else.

00:22:59.960 --> 00:23:00.360
Just $0.

00:23:01.919 --> 00:23:04.600
So let's say after select image,

00:23:04.880 --> 00:23:09.360
I'm going to select the h2 below.

00:23:09.880 --> 00:23:14.440
So now $0 becoming h2, because it's the current selected.

00:23:14.720 --> 00:23:17.840
And $1 becoming the previous.

00:23:18.120 --> 00:23:20.476
So you can do it until like four times, right?

00:23:20.559 --> 00:23:21.557
The previous previous.

00:23:21.640 --> 00:23:23.397
But usually you just do the current one,

00:23:23.480 --> 00:23:24.637
I think that's easiest.

00:23:24.720 --> 00:23:30.440
So, that's the utility.

00:23:30.880 --> 00:23:34.800
And then we got this dollar, dollar sign.

00:23:35.080 --> 00:23:36.959
So I'll go to the next slide.

00:23:37.559 --> 00:23:38.317
This one is easy.

00:23:38.400 --> 00:23:41.480
Dollar sign is equivalent to

00:23:42.840 --> 00:23:46.840
𝚍𝚘𝚌𝚞𝚖𝚎𝚗𝚝.𝚚𝚞𝚎𝚛𝚢𝚂𝚎𝚕𝚎𝚌𝚝𝚘𝚛, just shorter.

00:23:47.039 --> 00:23:48.000
That's just shorter.

00:23:48.320 --> 00:23:50.039
Sometimes I forgot what it is,

00:23:50.240 --> 00:23:51.679
so I just use dollar sign.

00:23:52.279 --> 00:23:54.920
Dollar dollar sign, two dollar signs,

00:23:55.360 --> 00:23:59.677
which means 𝚍𝚘𝚌𝚞𝚖𝚎𝚗𝚝.𝚚𝚞𝚎𝚛𝚢𝚂𝚎𝚕𝚎𝚌𝚝𝚘𝚛𝙰𝚕𝚕, right?

00:23:59.760 --> 00:24:02.357
So you can select everything.

00:24:02.440 --> 00:24:06.639
It's going to return you an array of stuff to query.

00:24:07.159 --> 00:24:11.437
Nowadays, you likely not doing it all the time,

00:24:11.520 --> 00:24:15.760
but still helpful to know sometimes, right?

00:24:16.360 --> 00:24:17.917
Next thing is interesting.

00:24:18.000 --> 00:24:20.480
console.log with style.

00:24:21.520 --> 00:24:23.836
Anyone tried to open DevTools in Facebook before?

00:24:23.919 --> 00:24:25.360
You seen it?

00:24:27.039 --> 00:24:30.836
So, you've been wondering how they can do this stuff,

00:24:30.919 --> 00:24:36.760
look so big and red?

00:24:37.520 --> 00:24:37.997
Sorry.

00:24:38.080 --> 00:24:39.879
I got a call in Singapore.

00:24:40.640 --> 00:24:42.520
That's a door.

00:24:43.200 --> 00:24:46.840
So, as an engineer, you're going to try to look for it

00:24:47.200 --> 00:24:48.157
on the source code, right?

00:24:48.240 --> 00:24:51.199
You look for stuff with the exclamation mark,

00:24:51.559 --> 00:24:52.799
then you see it in the code.

00:24:53.559 --> 00:24:56.076
And then you see, oh, that's the stuff, absolutely,

00:24:56.159 --> 00:24:57.359
that's what I'm looking for.

00:24:58.039 --> 00:25:03.239
And then, oh, somehow they can inject some styling.

00:25:03.679 --> 00:25:05.596
And then, that what I try to do, right?

00:25:05.679 --> 00:25:10.800
So basically, you can do this %c,

00:25:11.640 --> 00:25:17.680
and then you can do some color or CSS property into it.

00:25:18.399 --> 00:25:21.196
Not super helpful, but it's going to be something fun,

00:25:21.279 --> 00:25:22.080
I think.

00:25:22.600 --> 00:25:23.480
Something like that.

00:25:29.159 --> 00:25:33.237
But the more interesting thing is like you can set some

00:25:33.320 --> 00:25:34.360
styling with CSS.

00:25:35.120 --> 00:25:38.480
Which means you can do something like you set the

00:25:38.600 --> 00:25:39.759
background image.

00:25:40.279 --> 00:25:45.040
Like you can render an image in console.

00:25:45.480 --> 00:25:48.879
Why would you want this? I have no idea.

00:25:49.559 --> 00:25:53.596
But it just works.

00:25:53.679 --> 00:25:55.600
I have no idea why you want to do it.

00:25:56.320 --> 00:25:58.596
But in case you are wondering whether it's going to work,

00:25:58.679 --> 00:25:59.357
yes, it's working.

00:25:59.440 --> 00:26:02.360
You can show an image in console.

00:26:03.200 --> 00:26:04.476
Of course, it's not a web version.

00:26:04.559 --> 00:26:06.037
It's not HTML, so right.

00:26:06.120 --> 00:26:07.240
It's good to know.

00:26:07.840 --> 00:26:10.039
I think that's all with console.

00:26:10.399 --> 00:26:12.037
Oh yeah, that's not all console.

00:26:12.120 --> 00:26:16.440
That's some of the most useful is the logpoint and the

00:26:18.399 --> 00:26:21.519
conditional breakpoint where you can change the behavior.

00:26:21.799 --> 00:26:25.879
So we go to next thing is cache, right?

00:26:26.399 --> 00:26:31.357
When you are developing like a web application, some

00:26:31.440 --> 00:26:35.040
people might say, "It works on my machine."

00:26:35.480 --> 00:26:39.240
Maybe your version is cached somehow.

00:26:39.600 --> 00:26:40.557
I don't know, right?

00:26:40.640 --> 00:26:43.397
So it is more like a myth, right?

00:26:43.480 --> 00:26:47.920
We know that you need to do force reload, command shift R,

00:26:48.120 --> 00:26:48.480
something.

00:26:49.440 --> 00:26:51.237
But no one really validates that.

00:26:51.320 --> 00:26:53.080
So we try to solve it now.

00:26:53.840 --> 00:26:56.640
So think about cache is like there's a box in a browser.

00:26:58.360 --> 00:27:01.320
When you visit the first time, there's nothing in the box.

00:27:01.520 --> 00:27:02.440
Nothing at all.

00:27:04.039 --> 00:27:08.917
But then the next time you visit it, because you visit it

00:27:09.000 --> 00:27:11.316
the first time, and the first time the browser is going

00:27:11.399 --> 00:27:13.119
to try to save something in the box.

00:27:13.799 --> 00:27:17.759
So subsequent, it will try to look for the box first.

00:27:18.240 --> 00:27:21.560
If it has some stuff, then it just returns from the box.

00:27:21.760 --> 00:27:22.639
Why not?

00:27:23.399 --> 00:27:24.517
Why would you want this?

00:27:24.600 --> 00:27:26.716
Of course, now it saves time and data, right?

00:27:26.799 --> 00:27:28.156
It's not like we don't know why.

00:27:28.239 --> 00:27:30.079
Obviously, it saves time and data.

00:27:30.440 --> 00:27:33.917
So it only requests for the non-cached version from the

00:27:34.000 --> 00:27:38.719
server instead of keep asking the server all the time.

00:27:39.399 --> 00:27:40.357
So, okay.

00:27:40.440 --> 00:27:43.917
I think it's very small, but it is the non-cached version

00:27:44.000 --> 00:27:45.880
of my website.

00:27:46.320 --> 00:27:49.797
And then I got a cached version.

00:27:49.880 --> 00:27:50.196
Don't worry.

00:27:50.279 --> 00:27:52.640
You don't have to see anything.

00:27:53.000 --> 00:27:57.760
But the important thing is it's a lot lighter.

00:27:58.159 --> 00:27:59.359
And it's a lot faster.

00:27:59.600 --> 00:28:00.357
That's the whole idea.

00:28:00.440 --> 00:28:00.880
That's it.

00:28:01.279 --> 00:28:07.680
The cache is going to speed up the speed of the website.

00:28:08.120 --> 00:28:10.557
And there's different kind of cache.

00:28:10.640 --> 00:28:12.120
You see that there's memory cache.

00:28:12.440 --> 00:28:13.560
We're storing in RAM.

00:28:14.159 --> 00:28:15.877
RAM is random access memory.

00:28:15.960 --> 00:28:20.117
So what I learn in computer science degree, it basically

00:28:20.200 --> 00:28:21.359
means faster.

00:28:21.799 --> 00:28:27.600
And then certain things go into disk cache in the hardware

00:28:27.720 --> 00:28:28.960
like in the disk, right?

00:28:30.000 --> 00:28:32.357
Like when you reload, it might still be there.

00:28:32.440 --> 00:28:36.799
In RAM, when you restart the machine, it's gone.

00:28:38.440 --> 00:28:41.838
So Google Chrome is deciding it based on several factors.

00:28:42.519 --> 00:28:44.640
But I think one of the factors is the resource size.

00:28:44.799 --> 00:28:48.117
So it depends on how big the file is, then it's going to

00:28:48.200 --> 00:28:51.760
decide on where to store what.

00:28:52.440 --> 00:28:54.196
But that is just the basic about the cache.

00:28:54.279 --> 00:28:57.360
But the more important question you are going to ask is

00:28:59.720 --> 00:29:01.000
how do you clear this?

00:29:01.840 --> 00:29:04.956
Like when you deploy to prod, how do you make sure that

00:29:05.039 --> 00:29:06.319
the cache is gone?

00:29:06.919 --> 00:29:09.639
That's involving like certain setup.

00:29:10.159 --> 00:29:12.277
But let's say you wanted to test it out on some machine

00:29:12.360 --> 00:29:15.799
and you want to just test the latest version.

00:29:16.919 --> 00:29:19.880
So we are going to look into next slide.

00:29:20.039 --> 00:29:23.196
And also, it's going to be helpful when you do active

00:29:23.279 --> 00:29:24.677
local development.

00:29:24.760 --> 00:29:27.680
You wanted to test it out in the latest version.

00:29:28.159 --> 00:29:30.600
So there's a few approaches that you can think of.

00:29:31.120 --> 00:29:32.759
There's three things, right?

00:29:32.960 --> 00:29:34.599
I think most of us know a few.

00:29:35.399 --> 00:29:37.357
But these three things I discovered recently.

00:29:37.440 --> 00:29:39.600
So there's clear browser cache.

00:29:39.720 --> 00:29:44.920
There is empty cache and hard reload and disable cache.

00:29:45.600 --> 00:29:48.560
Clear browser cache is simple.

00:29:50.039 --> 00:29:54.677
You right click again into any resources, and there's the

00:29:54.760 --> 00:29:56.760
option say, "Clear browser cache."

00:29:56.919 --> 00:29:57.277
That's it.

00:29:57.360 --> 00:29:58.280
Easy, simple.

00:29:58.640 --> 00:30:01.039
It's going to say, "Yeah, of course. Going to clear."

00:30:01.559 --> 00:30:03.997
And it's important it's going to clear everything.

00:30:04.080 --> 00:30:07.040
So it's not just clearing this resources cache.

00:30:07.240 --> 00:30:09.079
Clearing everything.

00:30:09.279 --> 00:30:10.557
And then you need to refresh again.

00:30:10.640 --> 00:30:15.720
The second approach is like this one, if you long press

00:30:16.240 --> 00:30:19.716
the refresh button when the DevTools is open, this is

00:30:19.799 --> 00:30:21.280
going to open.

00:30:21.880 --> 00:30:22.117
Right?

00:30:22.200 --> 00:30:24.920
There's a

00:30:25.840 --> 00:30:27.196
Is it dialog something?

00:30:27.279 --> 00:30:29.799
There's a popover below is going to open.

00:30:30.240 --> 00:30:31.436
There's three option:

00:30:31.519 --> 00:30:36.196
normal reload, hard reload, and then empty cache

00:30:36.279 --> 00:30:39.159
and hard reload.

00:30:39.679 --> 00:30:42.196
And that is, someone has asked the same question,

00:30:42.279 --> 00:30:47.320
"What is the difference?" 13 years ago.

00:30:48.080 --> 00:30:52.320
In 2013, 11 years ago.

00:30:53.000 --> 00:30:55.716
So, that's my version of trying to explain it.

00:30:55.799 --> 00:30:57.800
So, normal reload is look for the cache.

00:30:58.399 --> 00:31:00.079
That's easy, that's simple.

00:31:00.519 --> 00:31:03.677
Hard reload, it just trying to load everything

00:31:03.760 --> 00:31:05.157
from server, right?

00:31:05.240 --> 00:31:06.480
Without looking for the boxes.

00:31:06.760 --> 00:31:09.840
But maybe, you only hard reload your website,

00:31:10.039 --> 00:31:12.517
but maybe the third party from like Google Analytics

00:31:12.600 --> 00:31:14.037
and stuff is still on the cache.

00:31:14.120 --> 00:31:15.720
So, it might still get from the cache.

00:31:15.960 --> 00:31:16.357
I think so.

00:31:16.440 --> 00:31:16.797
I hope.

00:31:16.880 --> 00:31:17.599
I assume.

00:31:17.840 --> 00:31:20.716
We couldn't find the official resources from Chrome.

00:31:20.799 --> 00:31:22.119
That's why I assume.

00:31:22.639 --> 00:31:24.797
And then, empty cache is just basically clear

00:31:24.880 --> 00:31:27.720
the whole thing and then trying to do it again, fresh.

00:31:29.200 --> 00:31:33.080
So, I think for us, most of the case,

00:31:33.760 --> 00:31:35.199
we want the third option.

00:31:36.039 --> 00:31:36.439
Yeah.

00:31:37.039 --> 00:31:39.596
The second option works as well, but you want to have

00:31:39.679 --> 00:31:42.720
the clean state, do the third option.

00:31:43.240 --> 00:31:45.800
And then, the last option,

00:31:46.200 --> 00:31:48.559
I think that's everyone know.

00:31:49.159 --> 00:31:52.680
Do you turn it on all the time?

00:31:53.360 --> 00:31:54.039
Because I do.

00:31:54.159 --> 00:31:56.280
I do turn it on all the time.

00:31:56.760 --> 00:31:59.919
And the reason why it works because Chrome now is

00:32:00.159 --> 00:32:05.199
forcing on of the HTTP requests to have this header

00:32:05.639 --> 00:32:07.559
called `𝙲𝚊𝚌𝚑𝚎-𝙲𝚘𝚗𝚝𝚛𝚘𝚕: 𝚗𝚘-𝚌𝚊𝚌𝚑𝚎`.

00:32:07.840 --> 00:32:11.076
To explain about cache and ETag and all of that

00:32:11.159 --> 00:32:13.397
is going to take another 40 minutes session.

00:32:13.480 --> 00:32:14.757
So, I'm going to come back next year

00:32:14.840 --> 00:32:15.519
and talk about it.

00:32:16.880 --> 00:32:18.880
But for now, that's all we need to know.

00:32:19.480 --> 00:32:20.397
So, you have it.

00:32:20.480 --> 00:32:24.600
There's three option to have your website fresh.

00:32:25.120 --> 00:32:27.640
Hope it answer, clear browser cache

00:32:28.440 --> 00:32:30.759
on the DevTools itself.

00:32:31.760 --> 00:32:34.397
The second one is when you press right click

00:32:34.480 --> 00:32:37.119
or long press it for a while, you see three option.

00:32:37.279 --> 00:32:39.279
And the last one is a checkbox.

00:32:39.639 --> 00:32:41.959
Most of us is going to look for the third one.

00:32:43.039 --> 00:32:43.359
Yeah.

00:32:44.039 --> 00:32:44.877
And then there's a lot more.

00:32:44.960 --> 00:32:48.240
There's like service worker cache and back and forth.

00:32:48.480 --> 00:32:49.157
Is it back forth?

00:32:49.240 --> 00:32:50.120
BF cache.

00:32:50.639 --> 00:32:52.917
Like when you navigate into the thing and go back,

00:32:53.000 --> 00:32:56.917
it doesn't really load the previous website.

00:32:57.000 --> 00:32:58.959
It's called BF cache in Chrome.

00:32:59.240 --> 00:33:00.840
This video is super helpful.

00:33:01.519 --> 00:33:03.117
And I want to share it in the end.

00:33:03.200 --> 00:33:05.039
Don't worry.

00:33:05.639 --> 00:33:07.076
Let me see how long I have.

00:33:07.159 --> 00:33:08.196
Okay, I have like seven minutes.

00:33:08.279 --> 00:33:10.560
So, next thing is snippets.

00:33:11.000 --> 00:33:14.119
When you need to run the same code over and over again,

00:33:14.279 --> 00:33:16.119
you can look for snippet.

00:33:16.559 --> 00:33:19.719
And instead of you copying the file somewhere,

00:33:19.919 --> 00:33:22.159
you can store it in Chrome.

00:33:22.679 --> 00:33:24.040
So, let me see.

00:33:24.720 --> 00:33:24.917
All right.

00:33:25.000 --> 00:33:31.436
So, in this video, I will go to snippet.

00:33:31.519 --> 00:33:32.956
I'm not sure if it is very small.

00:33:33.039 --> 00:33:34.240
Can you see it?

00:33:35.080 --> 00:33:35.959
I'm not very sure.

00:33:36.240 --> 00:33:38.480
Okay, maybe we do a live coding again.

00:33:39.080 --> 00:33:44.879
That's, obviously, showing video doesn't work very well.

00:33:45.559 --> 00:33:48.797
So, you can go into, you do command shift P, right?

00:33:48.880 --> 00:33:51.400
You can do snippet.

00:33:51.840 --> 00:33:53.200
Show snippet, right?

00:33:53.720 --> 00:33:55.280
I got a few already.

00:33:55.559 --> 00:34:01.840
I got a console image that you can render an image.

00:34:02.600 --> 00:34:07.237
And CSS layout debugger, which is super helpful.

00:34:07.320 --> 00:34:10.119
So, I going to run it now by right click

00:34:10.599 --> 00:34:13.760
and then say run.

00:34:14.639 --> 00:34:16.556
I need to make this thing on the left smaller

00:34:16.639 --> 00:34:18.040
so that you can see.

00:34:18.720 --> 00:34:20.359
Not sure if it's very clear.

00:34:20.879 --> 00:34:22.919
But this is going to just put a box

00:34:23.079 --> 00:34:25.519
in every single element in the page

00:34:25.639 --> 00:34:26.920
with a random color.

00:34:27.440 --> 00:34:30.197
Sometimes you wanted to see like how the composition

00:34:30.280 --> 00:34:31.677
of your layout look like.

00:34:31.760 --> 00:34:33.840
So, that could be helpful.

00:34:35.000 --> 00:34:37.319
The next thing I got is like alt text.

00:34:37.679 --> 00:34:38.800
Let me see if I have it.

00:34:38.919 --> 00:34:41.157
I don't.

00:34:41.240 --> 00:34:41.720
Google.

00:34:42.240 --> 00:34:43.720
So, that is Google I/O.

00:34:44.320 --> 00:34:48.639
And then if you go to Explore, see on section.

00:34:49.079 --> 00:34:51.840
And then I want to run another snippet.

00:34:52.280 --> 00:34:54.717
It's called, what's the button again?

00:34:54.800 --> 00:34:57.960
Okay, let me go to Sources, right?

00:34:58.200 --> 00:34:58.520
Here.

00:34:58.920 --> 00:34:59.756
No, not this.

00:34:59.839 --> 00:35:01.440
This one.

00:35:03.040 --> 00:35:04.160
Snippets.

00:35:05.200 --> 00:35:06.920
And then you do alt text.

00:35:07.359 --> 00:35:09.839
So, this is actually very simple.

00:35:10.359 --> 00:35:15.000
It is going to put an outline into every single image

00:35:15.520 --> 00:35:19.000
that doesn't have the alt attribute.

00:35:19.200 --> 00:35:20.957
Like, doesn't have the alternative text

00:35:21.040 --> 00:35:22.840
if the image is not found.

00:35:23.440 --> 00:35:25.717
But don't worry, I want to share the code at the end,

00:35:25.800 --> 00:35:26.880
but you can run it.

00:35:27.720 --> 00:35:30.957
And you can see even like website of Google,

00:35:31.040 --> 00:35:32.880
there's a lot of stuff was missing.

00:35:33.720 --> 00:35:36.840
Some cover photo is missing alt text.

00:35:37.280 --> 00:35:39.560
I was questioning.

00:35:39.680 --> 00:35:42.117
But yeah, it's helpful when you trying

00:35:42.200 --> 00:35:43.760
to debugging something.

00:35:44.200 --> 00:35:45.880
So, that is snippet.

00:35:46.160 --> 00:35:48.280
And I don't have a lot of time left.

00:35:48.440 --> 00:35:52.360
So, we jump into understand console with message,

00:35:52.520 --> 00:35:53.957
like with AI, right?

00:35:54.040 --> 00:35:54.319
It is 2024.

00:35:55.200 --> 00:35:57.599
We cannot leave the room without talking about AI.

00:36:01.599 --> 00:36:02.200
Let me see.

00:36:03.200 --> 00:36:05.880
Let's do it in the slide mode.

00:36:06.560 --> 00:36:11.680
So, you need to turn it on first.

00:36:12.200 --> 00:36:15.399
And then, we all know that this is a cross-origin

00:36:15.560 --> 00:36:18.276
when you are trying to make a request to the same origin,

00:36:18.359 --> 00:36:20.639
the same URL domain, it's going to work.

00:36:20.760 --> 00:36:22.200
But you try to cross domain,

00:36:22.400 --> 00:36:24.321
like GitHub to OpenAI,

00:36:24.599 --> 00:36:28.637
it will not work unless OpenAI explicitly say

00:36:28.720 --> 00:36:31.719
I allow GitHub to do it, for example.

00:36:34.839 --> 00:36:37.000
So it needs to configure it on a server

00:36:37.200 --> 00:36:39.240
and then it's going to return you a header.

00:36:39.680 --> 00:36:42.880
That is basic stuff I hope you all know about.

00:36:43.400 --> 00:36:44.276
If you don't know, that's fine.

00:36:44.359 --> 00:36:47.036
I mean, I learned it when I need to debug a bug,

00:36:47.119 --> 00:36:48.240
so that's normal.

00:36:49.960 --> 00:36:54.240
So it's going to work if you add in a header.

00:36:54.680 --> 00:36:57.557
But let's say, you see a bunch of error

00:36:57.640 --> 00:37:00.200
and you don't know where to go, where to start.

00:37:00.720 --> 00:37:02.000
And that is very common.

00:37:02.200 --> 00:37:06.637
So you can look for this thing on the right side.

00:37:06.720 --> 00:37:08.557
Now it's like understand this error, right?

00:37:08.640 --> 00:37:09.240
Look for it.

00:37:09.480 --> 00:37:09.960
Click.

00:37:10.359 --> 00:37:11.840
And then it's going to say,

00:37:12.280 --> 00:37:13.719
okay, we want to collect some data,

00:37:14.160 --> 00:37:16.000
going to give you some response.

00:37:16.440 --> 00:37:18.639
So that is AI in the DevTools for you.

00:37:18.960 --> 00:37:22.400
So you don't need to paste the error message into ChatGPT.

00:37:23.680 --> 00:37:25.520
So that is the error, right?

00:37:25.720 --> 00:37:29.036
So, the explain seems to be very accurate, right?

00:37:29.119 --> 00:37:31.440
I got a frontend application built with React.

00:37:31.960 --> 00:37:35.240
And then there's a Node.js server.

00:37:35.680 --> 00:37:37.840
And then I don't have this header configured.

00:37:40.079 --> 00:37:42.437
And then it suggests me something to do, right?

00:37:42.520 --> 00:37:48.880
It suggests me to say, okay, add this line or add this line.

00:37:49.480 --> 00:37:50.637
But in a lot of use cases,

00:37:50.720 --> 00:37:51.637
when you are developing,

00:37:51.720 --> 00:37:55.160
like some other team or some other company,

00:37:55.520 --> 00:37:57.996
they are controlling the API layer.

00:37:58.079 --> 00:37:59.320
You don't have control.

00:37:59.680 --> 00:38:01.996
And you need to connect to the staging server,

00:38:02.079 --> 00:38:02.957
for example, right?

00:38:03.040 --> 00:38:04.959
You know, sandbox.

00:38:05.760 --> 00:38:06.397
One minute left.

00:38:06.480 --> 00:38:06.960
Sorry.

00:38:07.079 --> 00:38:07.479
Okay.

00:38:08.000 --> 00:38:09.520
Need to go faster.

00:38:10.680 --> 00:38:12.320
So I can add it to my code.

00:38:12.920 --> 00:38:14.839
But the interesting thing is

00:38:15.160 --> 00:38:20.120
like you can start to override the header locally.

00:38:20.680 --> 00:38:24.117
So you can just select the failed request

00:38:24.200 --> 00:38:26.159
and you say override header.

00:38:26.599 --> 00:38:29.477
So Chrome is going to ask for a bunch of permission

00:38:29.560 --> 00:38:30.360
and all of that.

00:38:30.960 --> 00:38:32.560
And then, I need to go faster.

00:38:33.000 --> 00:38:33.600
At the end.

00:38:34.119 --> 00:38:37.276
And then you see that there's a lot of stuff,

00:38:37.359 --> 00:38:39.440
but now you can add a header.

00:38:39.960 --> 00:38:40.840
This thing is new.

00:38:41.079 --> 00:38:45.480
You can add a like override a header locally.

00:38:45.920 --> 00:38:47.280
And then I'll just going to add it.

00:38:47.800 --> 00:38:51.400
Sorry, I need to run it fast because it's ended.

00:38:52.640 --> 00:38:55.477
But you can see a lot of icon to mark

00:38:55.560 --> 00:38:57.640
that this thing is override, right?

00:38:59.359 --> 00:39:06.400
And then, afterward, now it's still error.

00:39:07.000 --> 00:39:09.200
But after you override, it goes through.

00:39:09.520 --> 00:39:11.756
Because it simulates that this request

00:39:11.839 --> 00:39:14.520
is going to return me this header

00:39:14.920 --> 00:39:18.197
so that the browser doesn't retell me the issue anymore.

00:39:18.280 --> 00:39:19.397
So that is super helpful

00:39:19.480 --> 00:39:20.797
when you are depending on the other team,

00:39:20.880 --> 00:39:22.800
for example, to add it for you.

00:39:25.200 --> 00:39:25.400
Okay.

00:39:25.560 --> 00:39:26.957
We skip the whole thing at the end.

00:39:27.040 --> 00:39:29.800
I think I don't have enough time.

00:39:30.119 --> 00:39:37.360
So, with that, the best tool,

00:39:37.960 --> 00:39:39.996
like the one you don't think of, it just works.

00:39:40.079 --> 00:39:41.440
You know something.

00:39:41.560 --> 00:39:42.557
The next time you come back,

00:39:42.640 --> 00:39:43.957
it's more like a muscle memory.

00:39:44.040 --> 00:39:44.597
It just works.

00:39:44.680 --> 00:39:45.760
You don't have to think.

00:39:46.480 --> 00:39:49.040
And remember the last three things.

00:39:49.319 --> 00:39:53.120
I think the last three is so important, so helpful.

00:39:53.560 --> 00:39:54.600
And then these two,

00:39:54.720 --> 00:39:56.797
like, you know, we usually learn

00:39:56.880 --> 00:39:59.077
when you are sitting next to other colleagues

00:39:59.160 --> 00:40:00.797
when you are doing pair programming.

00:40:00.880 --> 00:40:02.157
But now we do remote working,

00:40:02.240 --> 00:40:04.079
so it's rare to see it.

00:40:04.599 --> 00:40:06.920
So I hope that you got this idea.

00:40:07.520 --> 00:40:09.197
And I got a very packed schedule today,

00:40:09.280 --> 00:40:11.400
like I start in Singapore, like 7:00 a.m.

00:40:11.960 --> 00:40:13.280
I landed to Bangkok.

00:40:13.440 --> 00:40:14.360
I got lunch.

00:40:14.480 --> 00:40:15.557
I brought a snack.

00:40:15.640 --> 00:40:17.276
So do find me after the talk

00:40:17.359 --> 00:40:20.800
to redeem some of the snack from Singapore.

00:40:21.000 --> 00:40:22.557
And yeah.

00:40:22.640 --> 00:40:23.239
ขอบคุณครับ

00:40:23.440 --> 00:40:25.320
Thank you so much.

00:40:26.000 --> 00:40:26.717
That's the end of my talk.

00:40:26.800 --> 00:40:27.079
Hello.

00:40:27.319 --> 00:40:27.880
Thank you so much.

00:40:29.200 --> 00:40:31.120
I love this session.

00:40:31.920 --> 00:40:34.372
Open for the question.

00:40:34.455 --> 00:40:35.320
What is the slide?

00:40:35.640 --> 00:40:36.276
That's the link.

00:40:36.359 --> 00:40:39.437
That's the QR code.

00:40:39.520 --> 00:40:40.240
Let's scan again.

00:40:40.440 --> 00:40:40.837
Thank you.

00:40:40.920 --> 00:40:43.419
Thank you, Trung Vo manager.

00:40:43.559 --> 00:40:44.580
Manager at Ascenda.

00:40:45.160 --> 00:40:45.639
Thank you.

00:40:46.240 --> 00:40:46.397
Okay.

00:40:46.480 --> 00:40:51.037
Can we take a photo with you?

00:40:51.920 --> 00:40:52.240
Yay!

00:40:59.280 --> 00:41:01.880
Thank you so much.

00:41:02.560 --> 00:41:02.960
Okay.
