  Can an application be a monolith and microservices at the same time? Spoiler alert: Yes! In this session, we will explore a TypeScript codebase that defies the traditional boundaries. Much like Schrödinger's famous thought experiment, the application exists in multiple states simultaneously during development, but it's true form is only revealed at the moment of deployment. We'll uncover tools that empower developers to dance between monoliths and microservices, embracing the fluidity of development. Whether you're a seasoned developer, a curious architect, or simply excited about the future of software, this session is for you. So, buckle up as we dive into the unknown, question the status quo, and redefine the boundaries of what's possible in modern application development.
