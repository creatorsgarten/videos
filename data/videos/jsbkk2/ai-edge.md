  Open Source libraries like Transformer.js allow you to run Machine Learning workloads right within your browser. We can perform multi-language speech recognition and translation, text-to-speech, and even RAG, fully offline and in-browser! In this session we take a look at some examples of what's possible, as well as a small look behind the scenes at Microsoft's open source ONNX Runtime which makes this possible. Hopefully this session can inspire you to sprinkle some AI into your client applications!
