  Dating apps can feel tedious and like a waste of time. Is there a way to skip the grunt work? That’s what I asked myself six months ago when I built Swipr, a tool written in JavaScript that does the swiping for you. In this talk we’ll see how it works and how to built CLIs with Node along the way.
