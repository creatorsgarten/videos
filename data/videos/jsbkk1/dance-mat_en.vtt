00:00:06.000 --> 00:00:10.279
Please give a big round of applause to Mr. Ramón Huidobro.

00:00:23.320 --> 00:00:25.157
Thanks a lot for that wonderful introduction

00:00:25.240 --> 00:00:27.239
and hello everyone, good afternoon.

00:00:27.439 --> 00:00:29.160
How about this conference, huh?

00:00:32.360 --> 00:00:33.717
What a day it's been,

00:00:33.800 --> 00:00:35.597
so much wonderful knowledge shared,

00:00:35.680 --> 00:00:37.077
so much wonderful people,

00:00:37.160 --> 00:00:38.520
and here I am to ruin it.

00:00:38.680 --> 00:00:40.520
I'm just kidding.

00:00:41.160 --> 00:00:45.917
Listen, if you were having some trouble seeing my slides

00:00:46.000 --> 00:00:48.439
or if you want to get a peek at what's coming up,

00:00:48.640 --> 00:00:49.636
I've left a link there,

00:00:49.719 --> 00:00:58.837
ramonh.dev/dance-mat-js.pdf.

00:00:58.920 --> 00:01:01.119
You can follow my slides there just in case.

00:01:01.280 --> 00:01:02.440
So, hello.

00:01:03.600 --> 00:01:05.999
Quick word of warning before we begin.

00:01:06.600 --> 00:01:09.676
There is going to be some music in this talk,

00:01:09.759 --> 00:01:12.559
so you'll be hearing some nice stuff.

00:01:13.840 --> 00:01:14.797
My name is Ramón.

00:01:14.880 --> 00:01:16.439
I'm so happy to meet all of you.

00:01:16.680 --> 00:01:17.676
Some of you I've already met

00:01:17.759 --> 00:01:19.320
and talking to you throughout the day.

00:01:20.000 --> 00:01:21.076
I live in Austria, I said.

00:01:21.159 --> 00:01:22.277
I'm originally from Chile,

00:01:22.360 --> 00:01:23.957
but I've been living in Vienna for 20 years,

00:01:24.040 --> 00:01:26.399
so I don't really say I'm Chilean anymore.

00:01:26.880 --> 00:01:29.197
Yeah, I do some freelancing and working with children,

00:01:29.280 --> 00:01:30.637
but you're not interested in that.

00:01:30.720 --> 00:01:32.036
You probably saw my web,

00:01:32.119 --> 00:01:34.036
the picture of me on the website and thought,

00:01:34.119 --> 00:01:35.356
"Hey, I saw a dog there.

00:01:35.439 --> 00:01:37.200
Can we get more pictures of the dog?"

00:01:37.680 --> 00:01:39.837
Yes, don't worry, I've got you covered.

00:01:39.920 --> 00:01:40.840
This is Fiona.

00:01:41.360 --> 00:01:42.640
I love her so much.

00:01:43.119 --> 00:01:45.680
She came into our lives like three, four years ago

00:01:45.880 --> 00:01:47.080
and she's got these eyes.

00:01:47.600 --> 00:01:49.880
She looks at you and says so many things.

00:01:50.479 --> 00:01:52.517
I particularly love this photo at the top right

00:01:52.600 --> 00:01:53.716
where she's judging my wife

00:01:53.799 --> 00:01:55.559
as she eats some tasty mango.

00:01:56.640 --> 00:01:58.519
Yeah, I love her so much.

00:01:59.000 --> 00:02:00.636
Well, enough about me,

00:02:00.719 --> 00:02:02.277
let's talk about dancing,

00:02:02.360 --> 00:02:04.680
in particular dancing video games.

00:02:04.920 --> 00:02:07.076
Now, I want to get some hands up from everybody.

00:02:07.159 --> 00:02:11.279
Does anybody know Just Dance?

00:02:11.879 --> 00:02:12.317
I see.

00:02:12.400 --> 00:02:14.919
Oh, I see a couple enthusiastic hands over the back.

00:02:15.160 --> 00:02:17.117
Yeah, that's I never played it myself actually,

00:02:17.200 --> 00:02:18.320
but it seems pretty fun.

00:02:18.720 --> 00:02:19.997
Let's try something a little more recent.

00:02:20.080 --> 00:02:23.080
Does anybody know Beat Saber?

00:02:23.760 --> 00:02:27.000
Yes, some enthusiastic people, that's awesome.

00:02:27.360 --> 00:02:28.920
I tried it recently.

00:02:29.200 --> 00:02:30.759
It's super fun.

00:02:31.760 --> 00:02:33.117
I'm a little more old school myself.

00:02:33.200 --> 00:02:36.960
I grew up with a game called Dance Dance Revolution,

00:02:37.239 --> 00:02:39.040
or as I'm going to call it from now on, DDR.

00:02:39.640 --> 00:02:40.677
So let's see a show of hands.

00:02:40.760 --> 00:02:42.759
Who knows DDR?

00:02:44.120 --> 00:02:44.960
Yeah, nice.

00:02:46.159 --> 00:02:49.357
If you don't know it, it's a dancing video game.

00:02:49.440 --> 00:02:51.000
You can see here in this handy gif.

00:02:52.080 --> 00:02:53.516
You've got some arrows on the floor.

00:02:53.599 --> 00:02:56.357
Each of these are a button that you press to the rhythm

00:02:56.440 --> 00:02:59.400
to make it look like you're dancing semi-competently.

00:03:00.519 --> 00:03:01.197
It's a lot of fun.

00:03:01.280 --> 00:03:02.080
It's pretty old.

00:03:02.640 --> 00:03:03.997
If you see the screenshot,

00:03:04.080 --> 00:03:06.240
it's from the PlayStation 1 days,

00:03:07.040 --> 00:03:08.000
but it's a lot of fun.

00:03:08.120 --> 00:03:11.156
And you know, given that it's from the PlayStation 1 days,

00:03:11.239 --> 00:03:16.040
you might realize the music is well, it's something else.

00:03:16.400 --> 00:03:17.160
Let me tell you.

00:03:17.480 --> 00:03:18.800
I'm going to play a demo for you

00:03:18.920 --> 00:03:20.480
of what the music sounds like.

00:03:20.760 --> 00:03:28.720
Hopefully this will work.

00:03:29.400 --> 00:03:31.400
Oh my god, it's just so good.

00:03:32.439 --> 00:03:36.199
So, my wife Big Ed and I, we wanted to play some DDR

00:03:36.519 --> 00:03:37.239
recently.

00:03:37.519 --> 00:03:42.076
And while getting a PlayStation and some mats or going

00:03:42.159 --> 00:03:44.317
to an arcade, we don't have a lot of arcades in

00:03:44.400 --> 00:03:44.917
Austria.

00:03:45.000 --> 00:03:47.677
So, the best option for us was to download an

00:03:47.760 --> 00:03:52.039
open-source piece of software called StepMania.

00:03:52.239 --> 00:03:54.399
Does anybody know it?

00:03:55.400 --> 00:03:55.917
Yeah, cool.

00:03:56.000 --> 00:03:57.640
A couple of people know it, that's awesome.

00:03:57.799 --> 00:04:00.277
And it's a lot of fun and what's great is, as I said,

00:04:00.360 --> 00:04:03.156
it's open source, which means you can put any song you

00:04:03.239 --> 00:04:03.880
want on it,

00:04:04.319 --> 00:04:06.837
program it in order to have your dance moves ready for

00:04:06.920 --> 00:04:08.399
it, which is pretty fun.

00:04:09.879 --> 00:04:14.356
And for the hardware itself, you can have these pretty

00:04:14.439 --> 00:04:15.880
cheap foam mats.

00:04:16.479 --> 00:04:19.399
Now, the way they work is that instead of being a

00:04:19.519 --> 00:04:21.199
button physically per se,

00:04:22.000 --> 00:04:25.477
it's more of a contact that when you push it, it

00:04:25.560 --> 00:04:26.637
presses the button.

00:04:26.720 --> 00:04:29.480
And it's great and they're pretty affordable.

00:04:30.039 --> 00:04:32.477
Problem is that after some time, especially if you're

00:04:32.560 --> 00:04:37.000
using it as intensely as we are, they wear out, right?

00:04:37.120 --> 00:04:40.040
So we started getting used to seeing this screen a lot.

00:04:40.720 --> 00:04:43.517
So what we thought instead is I remember when I was a

00:04:43.600 --> 00:04:44.080
child,

00:04:44.360 --> 00:04:47.357
they had these metallic mats that you could play with

00:04:47.440 --> 00:04:48.039
at home.

00:04:48.320 --> 00:04:53.480
And I looked these up and they're pretty expensive.

00:04:53.680 --> 00:04:56.320
Now, you might think, huh, $300, it's about 10,000

00:04:56.919 --> 00:04:58.720
baht if I'm not mistaken.

00:05:00.440 --> 00:05:04.597
$300 is a lot of money, but notice that's a discount

00:05:04.680 --> 00:05:05.080
from $900.

00:05:07.919 --> 00:05:09.757
That's a lot of money for just a mat.

00:05:09.840 --> 00:05:11.799
So we thought, okay, well, we forgot about it.

00:05:13.160 --> 00:05:15.357
Then after some time, we were at this event in Vienna

00:05:15.440 --> 00:05:16.519
called the Maker Faire.

00:05:17.039 --> 00:05:19.040
Does that exist here?

00:05:19.840 --> 00:05:20.240
Yeah?

00:05:20.840 --> 00:05:21.396
Excellent.

00:05:21.479 --> 00:05:25.396
Well, what it is, is a showcase for lots of people

00:05:25.479 --> 00:05:26.956
making their own tinkering stuff.

00:05:27.039 --> 00:05:30.157
And I'm not very familiar with hardware myself

00:05:30.240 --> 00:05:30.637
at the time.

00:05:30.720 --> 00:05:32.400
So I thought, oh, I'll go check it out.

00:05:32.759 --> 00:05:35.757
And then I discovered a piece of hardware,

00:05:35.840 --> 00:05:39.560
if we can call it that, called Bare Conductive paint.

00:05:40.080 --> 00:05:41.479
Anybody heard of it?

00:05:42.319 --> 00:05:43.760
I see a hand.

00:05:44.919 --> 00:05:47.197
What it is, is you might have seen on like Facebook

00:05:47.280 --> 00:05:48.479
videos or something.

00:05:48.800 --> 00:05:51.556
What it is, is a paint that allows you to draw

00:05:51.639 --> 00:05:54.560
your own electronic circuits.

00:05:54.840 --> 00:05:56.877
So you could draw like a line from a battery

00:05:56.960 --> 00:05:58.477
to a light bulb, back to the battery,

00:05:58.560 --> 00:06:01.320
and it'll light the light bulb, which is cool and all.

00:06:01.479 --> 00:06:03.160
But as you can see in this photo,

00:06:03.280 --> 00:06:06.437
what I did not know is it's also capacitive,

00:06:06.520 --> 00:06:08.840
which means it can carry a charge if you touch it.

00:06:09.240 --> 00:06:11.680
So when I saw this, we started thinking like,

00:06:13.639 --> 00:06:16.599
hmm, I could make something with this.

00:06:17.199 --> 00:06:18.280
So I checked it out.

00:06:18.960 --> 00:06:21.516
It turns out they have some nice open source software

00:06:21.599 --> 00:06:23.680
that you can use in order to interact with it.

00:06:24.639 --> 00:06:26.879
And it even works with a Raspberry Pi.

00:06:27.639 --> 00:06:30.077
And my favorite part, a piece of code

00:06:30.160 --> 00:06:32.040
that I can copy and paste directly to try.

00:06:32.759 --> 00:06:42.719
So I looked at that and I thought, hmm.

00:06:44.560 --> 00:06:46.477
Could definitely make something with this.

00:06:46.560 --> 00:06:48.920
So I took a look, another look at StepMania,

00:06:49.120 --> 00:06:51.920
and it had customizable controls.

00:06:52.280 --> 00:06:53.360
That's pretty cool.

00:06:53.759 --> 00:06:55.437
So we thought, okay, my wife and I thought,

00:06:55.520 --> 00:06:58.919
alright, let's take a yoga mat,

00:06:59.759 --> 00:07:02.159
some of the paint, a Raspberry Pi Zero,

00:07:02.680 --> 00:07:04.959
one of the hats for interacting with the paint,

00:07:05.400 --> 00:07:06.360
a little Node.js,

00:07:06.720 --> 00:07:11.120
we've got ourselves project dance mat.

00:07:11.800 --> 00:07:13.396
And what an adventure it was,

00:07:13.479 --> 00:07:15.400
and this is what I'm here to share with you today.

00:07:15.879 --> 00:07:17.040
Quick disclaimer,

00:07:17.160 --> 00:07:19.836
this is my first ever hardware project.

00:07:19.919 --> 00:07:25.199
So, I'm going in a little bit unprepared for it.

00:07:26.039 --> 00:07:27.319
So here's the plan.

00:07:27.919 --> 00:07:30.717
You plug the dance mat into the computer,

00:07:30.800 --> 00:07:31.637
the computer thinks,

00:07:31.720 --> 00:07:33.317
"Aha! This is a keyboard.

00:07:33.400 --> 00:07:34.760
I shall treat it as such,

00:07:34.879 --> 00:07:37.719
and then I can customize my controls on StepMania."

00:07:38.199 --> 00:07:38.919
Fantastic.

00:07:39.199 --> 00:07:40.836
So, let's get started.

00:07:40.919 --> 00:07:42.997
We've got our piece of code here.

00:07:43.080 --> 00:07:46.637
What it does is you set it up so that it's linked up

00:07:46.720 --> 00:07:49.439
to the hat that's connected to the Raspberry Pi,

00:07:50.120 --> 00:07:51.719
and when it receives data,

00:07:51.960 --> 00:07:54.477
we have that big comment that I left myself there,

00:07:54.560 --> 00:07:56.799
"Send data to PC."

00:07:57.639 --> 00:08:00.236
And that's where I found my first piece of trouble,

00:08:00.319 --> 00:08:02.600
because I didn't know this going in,

00:08:02.960 --> 00:08:05.836
but if you just plug a Raspberry Pi into a computer,

00:08:05.919 --> 00:08:07.559
the computer's not going to immediately go,

00:08:07.840 --> 00:08:09.719
"Oh, this is a keyboard, of course."

00:08:10.080 --> 00:08:12.000
Now, some of you might be thinking,

00:08:12.639 --> 00:08:15.437
"Ramón, did you seriously not research this

00:08:15.520 --> 00:08:16.360
before going in?"

00:08:17.039 --> 00:08:18.120
And to that I say,

00:08:18.400 --> 00:08:19.560
may I remind you,

00:08:19.800 --> 00:08:23.439
this is my first time trying something like this, okay?

00:08:23.720 --> 00:08:25.760
But I did some research.

00:08:26.120 --> 00:08:26.959
So it turns out,

00:08:27.120 --> 00:08:28.399
because the Raspberry Pi,

00:08:28.840 --> 00:08:29.757
which if you don't know,

00:08:29.840 --> 00:08:31.717
is a, at least this model here,

00:08:31.800 --> 00:08:34.800
is a $10 piece of hardware that runs Linux

00:08:35.320 --> 00:08:38.920
and allows itself to be completely modded.

00:08:39.599 --> 00:08:43.560
Haha! It can be configured to act like a USB gadget.

00:08:44.000 --> 00:08:45.397
I found some documentation here,

00:08:45.480 --> 00:08:46.277
I started reading it,

00:08:46.360 --> 00:08:47.880
I gave up immediately,

00:08:48.000 --> 00:08:50.160
and did some Googling,

00:08:50.440 --> 00:08:51.837
and I found this,

00:08:51.920 --> 00:08:55.357
a nice handy dandy guide to teach me how to turn

00:08:55.440 --> 00:08:57.597
a Raspberry Pi and tell a computer,

00:08:57.680 --> 00:08:59.320
"Haha! I am a keyboard."

00:08:59.519 --> 00:09:02.120
Now this takes place in two steps.

00:09:02.399 --> 00:09:04.957
Step number one is to enable what is called

00:09:05.040 --> 00:09:06.960
Raspberry Pi On-The-Go mode,

00:09:07.120 --> 00:09:08.479
which I really like the name.

00:09:09.279 --> 00:09:12.960
Step number two is to add a script so that when we

00:09:14.360 --> 00:09:16.316
plug the Raspberry Pi into the computer,

00:09:16.399 --> 00:09:17.359
the computer says,

00:09:17.600 --> 00:09:18.880
"Huh, wait a minute, what's this?"

00:09:19.600 --> 00:09:21.157
And the Raspberry Pi will have a little script

00:09:21.240 --> 00:09:21.677
that says,

00:09:21.760 --> 00:09:23.280
"No, no, don't worry, don't worry, it's cool.

00:09:23.560 --> 00:09:26.520
I'm a keyboard."

00:09:27.079 --> 00:09:30.360
Now, the way the USB on-the-go mode works is that,

00:09:31.680 --> 00:09:35.319
there's two USB ports, mini USB ports on the Raspberry Pi.

00:09:35.600 --> 00:09:37.560
The first is for power, the other one's for USB.

00:09:38.760 --> 00:09:40.720
Data travels through the second port,

00:09:40.920 --> 00:09:42.157
but if you enable this mode,

00:09:42.240 --> 00:09:45.280
it can also act as a power, which is pretty cool.

00:09:45.800 --> 00:09:47.917
So all I had to do was run these three commands,

00:09:48.000 --> 00:09:49.037
don't worry about what they say,

00:09:49.120 --> 00:09:50.160
I'll tell you what they do.

00:09:50.560 --> 00:09:52.756
What they do is essentially be copy-pasted

00:09:52.839 --> 00:09:54.316
and let you do all the things you want.

00:09:54.399 --> 00:09:55.560
No, I'm just kidding.

00:09:56.240 --> 00:09:58.397
What they do is they allow you to configure

00:09:58.480 --> 00:10:01.920
your Raspberry Pi to say, "Hey, I'm a device."

00:10:02.440 --> 00:10:02.557
Right?

00:10:02.640 --> 00:10:04.080
So that's step one.

00:10:04.760 --> 00:10:08.640
Step two was having a script that runs on boot

00:10:09.000 --> 00:10:10.280
that tells the Raspberry Pi,

00:10:11.040 --> 00:10:13.316
"Hey, when I get plugged into a computer,

00:10:13.399 --> 00:10:15.200
I'm going to tell it I'm a keyboard."

00:10:15.480 --> 00:10:17.037
And it's this nice big chunk of code here

00:10:17.120 --> 00:10:18.640
that I have no idea what it does,

00:10:18.839 --> 00:10:21.520
except for three very important parts, which is this here.

00:10:22.040 --> 00:10:23.920
It, where I can tell it,

00:10:24.399 --> 00:10:27.237
this is my serial number, this is my manufacturer.

00:10:27.320 --> 00:10:29.436
You know, when you plug it in and Windows says,

00:10:29.519 --> 00:10:33.436
"Configuring blah blah blah by such and such manufacturer."

00:10:33.519 --> 00:10:35.199
That's all that mattered to me.

00:10:36.480 --> 00:10:39.399
So, I learned some things about, from this, by the way.

00:10:39.519 --> 00:10:42.037
I didn't know that there's a virtual file system

00:10:42.120 --> 00:10:44.876
that gets mounted on the Raspberry Pi automatically

00:10:44.959 --> 00:10:48.080
and lets you configure hardware stuff.

00:10:48.680 --> 00:10:51.917
And there's also so many configuration options

00:10:52.000 --> 00:10:54.917
that lets you mess around with

00:10:55.000 --> 00:10:57.637
what is essentially a $10 piece of hardware.

00:10:57.720 --> 00:11:01.359
I am learning already so much from this.

00:11:02.040 --> 00:11:04.277
So, once I had that running,

00:11:04.360 --> 00:11:06.517
the most exciting part came when I plugged it

00:11:06.600 --> 00:11:07.917
into my Windows machine

00:11:08.000 --> 00:11:11.196
and it made the most incredible sound.

00:11:11.279 --> 00:11:15.680
It went something like,

00:11:16.360 --> 00:11:17.840
It's an exciting sound, believe me.

00:11:18.279 --> 00:11:19.000
So, okay.

00:11:19.120 --> 00:11:23.037
Next up was to look into the USB human interface

00:11:23.120 --> 00:11:26.797
devices guide and learn how to send binary data

00:11:26.880 --> 00:11:29.280
from the Raspberry Pi to the computer to tell it,

00:11:29.519 --> 00:11:30.840
"This is a keystroke."

00:11:31.040 --> 00:11:32.797
And so I went to this website,

00:11:32.880 --> 00:11:35.000
I downloaded the 300-page PDF,

00:11:35.680 --> 00:11:36.876
and about five minutes later,

00:11:36.959 --> 00:11:39.277
I made that sound that like big,

00:11:39.360 --> 00:11:40.756
like a basset hound makes.

00:11:40.839 --> 00:11:41.837
You know what a basset hound is?

00:11:41.920 --> 00:11:45.080
It goes kind of like this.

00:11:45.760 --> 00:11:47.760
That's a lot of reading.

00:11:48.200 --> 00:11:49.157
Turns out I was very lucky

00:11:49.240 --> 00:11:50.677
and I was able to Google some stuff

00:11:50.760 --> 00:11:52.357
and talk to some friends who have more experience

00:11:52.440 --> 00:11:53.480
with hardware than I do.

00:11:54.240 --> 00:11:57.119
And it was a reminder to me that if I get stuck,

00:11:57.519 --> 00:11:59.320
it's fine to ask for help.

00:11:59.880 --> 00:12:00.996
People are happy to help,

00:12:01.079 --> 00:12:02.517
and if it's something they know about,

00:12:02.600 --> 00:12:05.120
they'll be enthusiastic to help you.

00:12:05.880 --> 00:12:07.996
So from that, I learned that each keystroke

00:12:08.079 --> 00:12:10.597
of a keyboard through the USB human interfaces

00:12:10.680 --> 00:12:14.357
guideline is an array of eight hexadecimal bytes.

00:12:14.440 --> 00:12:18.517
The first two are which are reserved for modifiers,

00:12:18.600 --> 00:12:20.359
like shift and all that.

00:12:20.959 --> 00:12:25.116
So, I found a list of hexadecimal codes

00:12:25.199 --> 00:12:26.800
that correspond to each key,

00:12:27.360 --> 00:12:29.637
which is great because then I was able to move back

00:12:29.720 --> 00:12:32.237
to my JavaScript and say,

00:12:32.320 --> 00:12:35.237
"All right, this is left, this is right,

00:12:35.320 --> 00:12:37.520
this is up, and this is down,"

00:12:38.120 --> 00:12:40.517
which is represented by four hexadecimal codes

00:12:40.600 --> 00:12:43.640
which represent the letters A, B, C, and D.

00:12:44.560 --> 00:12:48.959
I was already started and I was so excited.

00:12:49.399 --> 00:12:52.640
So I was able to plug that into a piece of code that says,

00:12:53.480 --> 00:12:56.760
okay, when I press some data, you see,

00:12:57.120 --> 00:13:01.397
the hat itself has 12 little nodes where I can attach

00:13:01.480 --> 00:13:02.480
an electrode.

00:13:02.639 --> 00:13:05.436
And each of these electrodes can correspond to a member

00:13:05.519 --> 00:13:06.239
of a list.

00:13:06.519 --> 00:13:09.477
So I can parse each electrode and tell it,

00:13:09.560 --> 00:13:11.640
depending on which one is pressed,

00:13:12.000 --> 00:13:15.040
pass onto that the corresponding key.

00:13:15.480 --> 00:13:17.116
So, if the first one is pressed,

00:13:17.199 --> 00:13:18.800
press add the left key.

00:13:19.160 --> 00:13:22.519
If the second one is pressed, put in the right key.

00:13:22.839 --> 00:13:26.160
And then up, and then down, and so on and so forth.

00:13:26.440 --> 00:13:27.316
So when I did that,

00:13:27.399 --> 00:13:31.600
I ended up with an array of touched codes.

00:13:31.959 --> 00:13:34.797
Now, you might notice this allows me to press more than

00:13:34.880 --> 00:13:36.239
one at the same time

00:13:36.600 --> 00:13:39.277
because with DDR, there might be sometimes where we

00:13:39.360 --> 00:13:40.756
might be doing a little bit of this,

00:13:40.839 --> 00:13:41.880
a little bit of that.

00:13:42.279 --> 00:13:44.320
So it's good to have.

00:13:45.000 --> 00:13:46.160
Once I've done that,

00:13:46.480 --> 00:13:48.720
I need to actually build a keystroke

00:13:48.880 --> 00:13:50.837
because as you saw earlier,

00:13:50.920 --> 00:13:53.280
it's made up of eight hexadecimal codes.

00:13:53.800 --> 00:13:58.797
So, the first two are made up of modifiers.

00:13:58.880 --> 00:14:00.196
So we'll skip those,

00:14:00.279 --> 00:14:01.957
and then I'll just put in the rest of the keys

00:14:02.040 --> 00:14:03.116
and put in a bunch of zeros

00:14:03.199 --> 00:14:05.960
just so it makes up a nice list of eight.

00:14:06.560 --> 00:14:07.840
Once I do that,

00:14:08.040 --> 00:14:10.560
I can actually start the script,

00:14:10.880 --> 00:14:12.160
plug in my Raspberry Pi,

00:14:12.519 --> 00:14:14.560
and start just looking at what's coming out.

00:14:14.880 --> 00:14:18.280
And you'll see I get a nice little A, or a B,

00:14:18.639 --> 00:14:20.957
or a C, or a C and a D, and all that.

00:14:21.040 --> 00:14:24.960
So, next up is converting that into a byte array.

00:14:25.279 --> 00:14:27.957
Now, again, documentation, super helpful,

00:14:28.040 --> 00:14:31.199
MDN allowed me to find this function here called

00:14:31.800 --> 00:14:32.280
𝚄𝚒𝚗𝚝𝟾𝙰𝚛𝚛𝚊𝚢.

00:14:32.680 --> 00:14:33.316
And from that,

00:14:33.399 --> 00:14:37.357
I was able to create a keystroke from that

00:14:37.440 --> 00:14:38.720
that is a byte array.

00:14:39.240 --> 00:14:46.520
Next, I got to send that over to the computer.

00:14:46.880 --> 00:14:50.200
And here I got stuck again.

00:14:50.800 --> 00:14:51.357
Now, as I said,

00:14:51.440 --> 00:14:53.556
I'm not very experienced with Linux and hardware

00:14:53.639 --> 00:14:54.157
and all that,

00:14:54.240 --> 00:14:55.917
but after some research,

00:14:56.000 --> 00:14:58.477
I found something called file descriptors.

00:14:58.560 --> 00:15:00.120
So for those of you who don't know,

00:15:00.440 --> 00:15:03.556
everything in Linux is a file in the file system.

00:15:03.639 --> 00:15:06.637
Everything from hardware devices to network devices

00:15:06.720 --> 00:15:09.280
to documents, they're all files.

00:15:09.759 --> 00:15:10.157
And I thought,

00:15:10.240 --> 00:15:13.957
all right, so I can pipe this byte array into the

00:15:14.040 --> 00:15:16.400
file descriptor of my USB device.

00:15:16.920 --> 00:15:18.116
And I did some searching around,

00:15:18.199 --> 00:15:20.800
and of course, because there is something for

00:15:20.920 --> 00:15:21.876
everything there,

00:15:21.959 --> 00:15:25.837
there's an npm package for this.

00:15:26.600 --> 00:15:29.637
And I was able to plug this npm package,

00:15:29.720 --> 00:15:33.720
say, all right, open up that USB file interface

00:15:33.920 --> 00:15:38.120
and with that, I'm able to simply write to it.

00:15:38.759 --> 00:15:39.839
Isn't that amazing?

00:15:40.120 --> 00:15:43.160
But of course, I'm a good citizen.

00:15:43.600 --> 00:15:46.440
Once the program ends, I have to close the device.

00:15:46.839 --> 00:15:48.399
Got to clean up after yourself.

00:15:48.639 --> 00:15:49.920
So let's try it out.

00:15:50.600 --> 00:15:52.680
Start up the program.

00:15:53.639 --> 00:15:55.560
Plug it in onto my computer.

00:15:55.920 --> 00:15:57.959
Open a text editor in my computer.

00:15:59.560 --> 00:16:00.800
Look at that.

00:16:01.480 --> 00:16:04.599
I've got A's, B's, and C's, and D's.

00:16:06.240 --> 00:16:07.477
It doesn't look like much,

00:16:07.560 --> 00:16:10.039
but I'm just tapping bits on an electrode.

00:16:10.319 --> 00:16:12.159
I've basically made a keyboard here.

00:16:12.519 --> 00:16:14.599
And here comes the fun part.

00:16:15.199 --> 00:16:16.357
Next up is the painting.

00:16:16.440 --> 00:16:18.400
My wife, Big Ed, and I got to work.

00:16:19.000 --> 00:16:20.480
We've laid it out.

00:16:20.800 --> 00:16:22.880
As you saw, we bought a yoga mat.

00:16:23.560 --> 00:16:24.717
We even made two players

00:16:24.800 --> 00:16:27.840
because you got to have two players in DDR.

00:16:28.600 --> 00:16:30.876
We then realized if you have two players

00:16:30.959 --> 00:16:32.800
that close together playing DDR,

00:16:33.440 --> 00:16:34.440
it could lead to some trouble.

00:16:35.079 --> 00:16:36.479
So we cut it in half

00:16:36.639 --> 00:16:39.120
and there's Big Ed painting everything.

00:16:39.240 --> 00:16:40.240
And we tried it.

00:16:40.800 --> 00:16:41.679
And did it work?

00:16:42.040 --> 00:16:42.360
Yes.

00:16:42.600 --> 00:16:43.920
Were we excellent?

00:16:44.040 --> 00:16:45.919
Kind of.

00:16:46.759 --> 00:16:49.960
But it worked.

00:16:50.480 --> 00:16:52.800
Now we could play StepMania or DDR

00:16:53.560 --> 00:16:56.959
with our very own dance mat that we made from scratch.

00:16:57.319 --> 00:17:00.200
Then the question becomes, are we set for life now?

00:17:00.720 --> 00:17:03.359
And honestly, it depends on how you look at it.

00:17:04.199 --> 00:17:05.637
You see, over time,

00:17:05.720 --> 00:17:08.159
if you're stepping on a yoga mat made of paint,

00:17:08.640 --> 00:17:09.560
something happens.

00:17:09.679 --> 00:17:10.437
Actually, I'll just show you.

00:17:10.520 --> 00:17:11.599
Computer, enhance.

00:17:11.720 --> 00:17:12.279
Thank you.

00:17:14.480 --> 00:17:17.720
If you put paint on a yoga mat,

00:17:17.919 --> 00:17:19.800
it's going to crack over time.

00:17:20.319 --> 00:17:22.799
So through this and some other problems,

00:17:23.520 --> 00:17:25.236
we started compiling a list of things

00:17:25.319 --> 00:17:28.360
that I like to call, "If we could do it all over again."

00:17:29.640 --> 00:17:30.836
So when I was talking to some friends

00:17:30.919 --> 00:17:34.040
and some bigger hardware people than I,

00:17:34.919 --> 00:17:35.997
the first thing they told me is,

00:17:36.080 --> 00:17:38.437
"Ramón, you should really just use an Arduino to do this."

00:17:38.520 --> 00:17:39.160
And I said,

00:17:39.280 --> 00:17:40.439
"Hey, that's a great idea.

00:17:40.679 --> 00:17:44.920
Quick question, what is an Arduino?"

00:17:45.360 --> 00:17:47.119
It's a microcomputer, by the way.

00:17:49.640 --> 00:17:51.677
We should use a smoother surface to do this.

00:17:51.760 --> 00:17:54.437
Turns out a yoga mat, sure, it's nice to be able

00:17:54.520 --> 00:17:57.600
to roll up and put away, but it cracks the paint.

00:17:58.280 --> 00:18:01.277
The other problem we had is that if you're using paint

00:18:01.360 --> 00:18:05.479
as a cable, it creates a lot of surface error potentials.

00:18:05.600 --> 00:18:10.997
So we started soldering on some cables onto our

00:18:11.080 --> 00:18:11.680
Raspberry Pi.

00:18:12.200 --> 00:18:15.637
The important thing though, is that through all this,

00:18:15.720 --> 00:18:19.240
we had a great time and we learned a whole bunch of stuff.

00:18:19.480 --> 00:18:21.596
And to prove that, here's a picture of us looking

00:18:21.679 --> 00:18:24.319
really happy.

00:18:24.919 --> 00:18:27.037
Now, you've been hearing me ramble on about this

00:18:27.120 --> 00:18:29.076
for a while, you're probably wondering, does it work?

00:18:29.159 --> 00:18:30.040
Is there a demo?

00:18:30.760 --> 00:18:32.600
The answer is yes-ish.

00:18:33.080 --> 00:18:37.117
You see, I can't bring a whole yoga mat all the way

00:18:37.200 --> 00:18:37.877
from Austria.

00:18:37.960 --> 00:18:42.440
So, I built one out of a smaller piece of cardboard.

00:18:42.559 --> 00:18:43.999
Here's the Mk Ⅰ.

00:18:45.000 --> 00:18:48.400
As you saw, it's using a lot of cables as for the paint,

00:18:48.760 --> 00:18:49.800
and it did work.

00:18:50.000 --> 00:18:52.320
And I was going to present this at HalfStack Vienna,

00:18:52.559 --> 00:18:56.517
and about five minutes before, the Raspberry Pi came loose

00:18:56.600 --> 00:18:57.917
and the cable wasn't working anymore,

00:18:58.000 --> 00:18:59.157
so I tried to repaint it,

00:18:59.240 --> 00:19:01.076
but then it connected two of them together.

00:19:01.159 --> 00:19:03.157
So I tried to fix it with a little bit of water,

00:19:03.240 --> 00:19:04.517
and that kind of smudged it.

00:19:04.600 --> 00:19:06.197
So I tried using a little bit more water

00:19:06.280 --> 00:19:08.920
and that smudged it even more, and ended up being a mess.

00:19:09.520 --> 00:19:12.720
So what I have for you here today is Mk Ⅱ.

00:19:13.799 --> 00:19:16.797
This one uses crocodile cables,

00:19:16.880 --> 00:19:18.920
which I never considered using.

00:19:19.080 --> 00:19:20.956
Now what you see here, and this is what I have here

00:19:21.039 --> 00:19:25.479
on stage, is four arrows and a cat.

00:19:25.720 --> 00:19:28.120
The cat button is start.

00:19:28.880 --> 00:19:31.397
Now, what is this, you're probably thinking,

00:19:31.480 --> 00:19:32.476
oh, this is super high-tech,

00:19:32.559 --> 00:19:33.437
I wonder what's underneath.

00:19:33.520 --> 00:19:35.120
I'll tell you, computer, flip!

00:19:35.440 --> 00:19:40.240
It's a pizza box!

00:19:41.000 --> 00:19:41.999
So let's try it out!

00:19:42.159 --> 00:19:43.880
I hope it's working.

00:19:44.320 --> 00:19:47.440
Good thing I have StepMania here.

00:19:48.120 --> 00:19:50.159
Alright, let's start it up.

00:19:50.919 --> 00:19:52.920
Start the music.

00:19:53.520 --> 00:19:55.836
Now, normally I would ask a volunteer to come up

00:19:55.919 --> 00:19:58.037
and play for me, but we're kind of short on time,

00:19:58.120 --> 00:20:05.760
so I'll just do it myself.

00:20:09.919 --> 00:20:11.720
Alright, here we go.

00:20:11.919 --> 00:20:12.720
Wish me luck.

00:20:59.293 --> 00:21:09.280
You get the point.

00:21:09.880 --> 00:21:10.716
You're too kind.

00:21:10.799 --> 00:21:12.557
That was a disgrace, and if I had continued,

00:21:12.640 --> 00:21:14.359
I would have gotten an F.

00:21:15.960 --> 00:21:18.399
Well, so that was me for today.

00:21:19.240 --> 00:21:21.397
For those of you who aren't experienced with hardware

00:21:21.480 --> 00:21:24.039
hacking or think it looks daunting, it is,

00:21:24.559 --> 00:21:26.196
but there's so much support out there.

00:21:26.279 --> 00:21:27.716
People are so helpful.

00:21:27.799 --> 00:21:28.960
There's so much to do.

00:21:29.360 --> 00:21:32.279
And I wouldn't stress about it.

00:21:32.480 --> 00:21:35.117
Yes, it's a bit more brittle than a piece of software,

00:21:35.200 --> 00:21:38.836
but those same principles that you love about developing

00:21:38.919 --> 00:21:43.159
software, be it web, native, mobile, and so on,

00:21:43.600 --> 00:21:44.716
they can be applied here.

00:21:44.799 --> 00:21:46.677
There's lots of JavaScript things out there.

00:21:46.760 --> 00:21:48.157
There's lots of Node things out there.

00:21:48.240 --> 00:21:50.237
There's lots of things in your favorite programming

00:21:50.320 --> 00:21:51.840
language, Ruby.

00:21:54.279 --> 00:21:55.760
Those are Ruby socks, by the way.

00:21:56.960 --> 00:21:58.836
There's just so much out there.

00:21:58.919 --> 00:22:01.877
And it's so important to just have fun and most

00:22:01.960 --> 00:22:03.760
importantly, just go for it.

00:22:04.200 --> 00:22:06.760
You know, you never know what will happen.

00:22:07.200 --> 00:22:11.439
Thanks a lot, folks.

00:22:12.039 --> 00:22:14.199
Thank you, Ramón.

00:22:14.799 --> 00:22:16.836
One more thing, I really want to see you dance over here

00:22:16.919 --> 00:22:17.397
on the stage.

00:22:17.480 --> 00:22:20.480
You do a real dance.

00:22:21.080 --> 00:22:23.596
Anyone would like to see Ramón to dance, real dance,

00:22:23.679 --> 00:22:26.400
on the stage?

00:22:27.000 --> 00:22:30.120
Come on, you got a big fan here in fact, in Thailand.

00:22:33.440 --> 00:22:33.877
I don't know.

00:22:33.960 --> 00:22:34.880
Can I have some music?

00:22:35.240 --> 00:22:36.440
Yeah! Wow!

00:22:37.120 --> 00:22:38.280
I'll be your dancer, too.

00:22:38.640 --> 00:22:41.960
Let's do it along together.

00:22:43.440 --> 00:22:50.742
Everyone, big warm applause for Ramón!

00:22:51.799 --> 00:22:53.997
Thank you, we love you from Thailand.

00:22:54.080 --> 00:22:54.340
Thank you, Ramón.

00:23:18.240 --> 00:23:23.757
So, I really love him for one of his main concepts,

00:23:23.840 --> 00:23:26.600
one of his main idea he would like to give you as a

00:23:27.760 --> 00:23:30.196
takeaway, which is play around with things.

00:23:30.279 --> 00:23:32.557
I think it's really amazing and it's good that you can

00:23:32.640 --> 00:23:39.476
apply this kind of idea for in every aspect of your

00:23:39.559 --> 00:23:40.239
life, too.
