description: 'Talking about "Scale": Takeaways from our attempt on scaling a small system in the Gojek Universe. The year is 2019 and every engineer must have been asked once to build a “scalable” system. I will be telling the story of our team journey in building a financial system that serves 20X traffic in less than a year. Engineering practices, wrong (and right!) decisions, process improvement and more!'
