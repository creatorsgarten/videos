00:00.000 --> 00:06.000
Hello everyone.

00:06.000 --> 00:15.000
I'm Riffy from Creatorsgarten.

00:15.000 --> 00:20.000
This session is a co-host session with Thai Pang.

00:20.000 --> 00:23.000
From Creatorsgarten.

00:23.000 --> 00:39.000
Today, we will see what we do with the background system of Creatorsgarten.

00:39.000 --> 00:43.000
We will divide the session into two parts.

00:43.000 --> 00:50.000
The first part will tell you about the process of making a video of the work.

00:50.000 --> 00:53.000
How we simplify the process.

00:53.000 --> 00:57.000
The second part will be a session of Thai Pang.

00:57.000 --> 00:59.000
He will show you the Contentsgarten.

00:59.000 --> 01:03.000
It is a background system that we made ourselves.

01:03.000 --> 01:07.000
We utilize many of the systems of GitHub.

01:07.000 --> 01:10.000
Let's get started.

01:10.000 --> 01:17.000
We have officially formed Creatorsgarten for 1-2 months.

01:17.000 --> 01:23.000
We have organized many things.

01:23.000 --> 01:26.000
We have organized many events.

01:26.000 --> 01:31.000
In addition to organizing many events, we have kept all the events that we live stream as archived.

01:31.000 --> 01:39.000
Another purpose of keeping the archive is to publish it on YouTube as a public archive.

01:39.000 --> 01:45.000
For others to be interested in the topic of the previous session.

01:45.000 --> 01:51.000
In the past, we did not have an event community that was organized like this.

01:51.000 --> 01:53.000
Every event will spread.

01:53.000 --> 02:03.000
We have made video sessions, post- processing sessions and uploaded on YouTube .

02:03.000 --> 02:08.000
Before starting streaming, we need to set up as the device as Rockstar.

02:08.000 --> 02:10.000
Like 1 hour ago.

02:10.000 --> 02:13.000
It's quite been around.

02:13.000 --> 02:17.000
Making archiving is really difficult.

02:17.000 --> 02:18.000
Because we have many tools.

02:18.000 --> 02:20.000
Right?

02:20.000 --> 02:28.000
We have computer speakers that only have a single slide.

02:28.000 --> 02:32.000
Some speakers may have to play a video sound.

02:32.000 --> 02:37.000
We don't know if they will use it.

02:37.000 --> 02:43.000
And now about the microphone that the speakers will use to speak.

02:43.000 --> 02:47.000
Because if it's in the clipboard, we've arranged a lot of clipboards.

02:47.000 --> 02:53.000
We know how the setup looks like.

02:53.000 --> 02:57.000
But when we move to another venue,

02:57.000 --> 03:03.000
it's called uncharted space.

03:03.000 --> 03:06.000
We don't know what they provide for us.

03:06.000 --> 03:08.000
It's our risk.

03:08.000 --> 03:10.000
If they don't have a microphone, where can we find it?

03:10.000 --> 03:12.000
Can we find it?

03:12.000 --> 03:15.000
Another thing is, can we have full control?

03:15.000 --> 03:17.000
If I speak too loudly,

03:17.000 --> 03:19.000
I can't control the sound.

03:19.000 --> 03:22.000
I can't control the output sound.

03:22.000 --> 03:25.000
What is the answer?

03:25.000 --> 03:28.000
The answer to this problem is to spend money.

03:28.000 --> 03:30.000
Rich!

03:30.000 --> 03:32.000
We use...

03:32.000 --> 03:34.000
In Creator Saturday,

03:34.000 --> 03:36.000
each session, each event,

03:36.000 --> 03:39.000
we receive sponsorship money from many sponsors.

03:39.000 --> 03:41.000
We use almost all of them.

03:41.000 --> 03:43.000
But which one...

03:43.000 --> 03:45.000
But which one we don't use all of them,

03:45.000 --> 03:46.000
we keep it.

03:46.000 --> 03:48.000
We keep the sum.

03:48.000 --> 03:50.000
And when we sum it into a pool,

03:50.000 --> 03:55.000
we use this amount of money to improve our workflow.

03:55.000 --> 03:57.000
We simplify everything.

03:57.000 --> 04:01.000
The video is embedded in ATEM Mini.

04:01.000 --> 04:06.000
We put video on ATEM Mini.

04:06.000 --> 04:10.000
Video that is projected on the screen like this.

04:10.000 --> 04:14.000
And the sound that flows into the software on Mac Mini.

04:14.000 --> 04:17.000
Wait, what?

04:17.000 --> 04:19.000
Is it a video that is projected with a built-in thumbset?

04:19.000 --> 04:21.000
In fact, this is a video.

04:21.000 --> 04:23.000
This is my sound source.

04:23.000 --> 04:24.000
Or does it match mine?

04:24.000 --> 04:25.000
OK.

04:25.000 --> 04:27.000
You can go back to.

04:27.000 --> 04:28.000
You can go back to.

04:28.000 --> 04:30.000
Which part?

04:30.000 --> 04:31.000
Which part?

04:31.000 --> 04:33.000
This is my hand.

04:33.000 --> 04:34.000
The part...

04:34.000 --> 04:35.000
Something?

04:35.000 --> 04:36.000
Then, where is it saved?

04:36.000 --> 04:37.000
You have to go over.

04:37.000 --> 04:38.000
All right.

04:38.000 --> 04:39.000
One more point.

04:39.000 --> 04:42.000
You can use your music Stretch machine,

04:42.000 --> 04:47.000
If it works, it's fine. If not, it's not. But if it works, don't fix it.

04:49.000 --> 04:58.000
When we go to each venue, we have to lock in what equipment they have for us.

04:58.000 --> 05:03.000
When we go to a place, we don't have to ask them what equipment they have.

05:03.000 --> 05:11.000
When we finished recording the live stream, it might take 3-5 hours.

05:11.000 --> 05:15.000
The file that came out of OBS is very large, 32GB.

05:15.000 --> 05:19.000
The size is not enough to be used in Final Cut.

05:19.000 --> 05:22.000
If we put it in Final Cut, it will be frozen.

05:22.000 --> 05:26.000
We have to optimize it first.

05:26.000 --> 05:34.000
For the answer, we have the FFmpeg command preset.

05:34.000 --> 05:39.000
We learn the code from the H.264 to H.265 archive.

05:39.000 --> 05:41.000
The size is the same.

05:41.000 --> 05:42.000
It's 32GB.

05:42.000 --> 05:44.000
The remaining is 5GB.

05:44.000 --> 05:49.000
It's sustainable enough that we can use it to cut in Final Cut.

05:49.000 --> 05:52.000
And it's also archived in PhysicalNAS.

05:52.000 --> 06:01.000
In case, in any event, the Creator Garden page becomes the Elon Musk live stream channel.

06:01.000 --> 06:04.000
We have a case for it.

06:04.000 --> 06:09.000
We've already recorded the video.

06:09.000 --> 06:11.000
Now we upload it to YouTube.

06:11.000 --> 06:16.000
But after uploading, we have to manage the content.

06:16.000 --> 06:20.000
Managing is harder than before.

06:20.000 --> 06:23.000
It's harder than what I've said.

06:23.000 --> 06:29.000
Because every video we make has its own consistency.

06:29.000 --> 06:34.000
The video title will have consistency.

06:34.000 --> 06:36.000
We start with the session.

06:36.000 --> 06:38.000
Followed by the speaker.

06:38.000 --> 06:42.000
Or if it's a stream, it's another format.

06:42.000 --> 06:49.000
If it's a session like many people, we can't include many people in the video.

06:49.000 --> 06:52.000
We have to put it in another format.

06:52.000 --> 06:59.000
Actually, we can manage it by hand.

06:59.000 --> 07:01.000
But it may be too difficult.

07:01.000 --> 07:06.000
And if there is another subtitle, how will we manage it?

07:06.000 --> 07:07.000
Okay.

07:07.000 --> 07:14.000
Thaj will giving us an example as the keynote.

07:14.000 --> 07:25.740
We

07:25.740 --> 07:27.000
can manage each video through the repository.

07:27.000 --> 07:30.000
And the board itself will take control of its own effects.

07:30.000 --> 07:35.000
When we manage each session,

07:35.000 --> 07:51.000
We can create a markdown file with metadata like title, speaker, effect, youtube id, and video description.

07:51.000 --> 08:08.000
For some videos, such as hackathon, we can create a code to select a specific type and take effect video title that look different.

08:08.000 --> 08:20.000
For subtitle, we don't have to keep a local file or keep it with youtube all the time.

08:20.000 --> 08:21.000
We can do it by ourselves.

08:21.000 --> 08:30.000
In this case, in the video library, we can upload subtitle file in VTT format, which is global standard.

08:30.000 --> 08:35.000
We can add it and then subtitle it.

08:36.000 --> 08:41.000
Another system that we have is Consistency.

08:41.000 --> 08:50.000
Consistency is not only about video title and description, but also about video and thumbnail.

08:50.000 --> 08:51.000
When we have a video title, we can add it to the subtitle.

08:51.000 --> 08:58.000
In the beginning, we intended to make each event look different.

08:58.000 --> 09:01.000
So that we can separate the event.

09:01.000 --> 09:12.000
But when we came to this, P'Type suggested that we make it have the same format consistency as Sakurai's video gaming channel.

09:12.000 --> 09:16.000
The solution we got is not an automation.

09:16.000 --> 09:20.000
But we use Figma's template system.

09:20.000 --> 09:25.000
When we made the video, we have a preset template.

09:25.000 --> 09:31.000
We have the header on the top and we put the video image at the back.

09:31.000 --> 09:39.000
And we put the text as a cache phrase.

09:39.000 --> 09:40.000
Like two bars.

09:40.000 --> 09:43.000
And now, we add Figma system.

09:43.000 --> 09:47.000
It's a very versatile system.

09:47.000 --> 09:51.500
As long as we can create the header as a component

09:51.500 --> 09:56.200
And when we go in and fix the component

09:56.200 --> 09:58.900
It will take effect with every video

09:58.900 --> 10:03.700
We don't need to fix the header one by one

10:03.700 --> 10:10.300
And when all files are finished

10:10.300 --> 10:17.100
We will run the event in GitHub Actions

10:17.100 --> 10:21.100
And the event will take effect on YouTube

10:21.100 --> 10:26.100
Why did we do all of this?

10:26.100 --> 10:29.100
That's it

10:29.100 --> 10:34.600
We did it because of the ownership

10:34.600 --> 10:40.200
Creators Garden is an open source group

10:40.200 --> 10:44.500
We have many ways to use the money

10:44.500 --> 10:45.500
We are open source

10:45.500 --> 10:47.500
We have a website

10:47.500 --> 10:54.300
But we can't grant the content to all the creators

10:54.300 --> 10:59.800
We can't give ownership to Creators Garden

10:59.800 --> 11:03.800
But we can open source the videos

11:03.800 --> 11:08.800
And when someone wants to make changes in the video

11:08.800 --> 11:09.800
We can send a pull request

11:09.800 --> 11:15.100
To fix the content in YouTube

11:15.100 --> 11:19.100
This is the concept of the video repository

11:19.100 --> 11:24.100
But we also utilize GitHub with another feature

11:24.100 --> 11:27.100
Which is YouTube channel banner

11:27.100 --> 11:33.100
I intend to adapt the YouTube channel banner to each event

11:33.100 --> 11:36.100
When there is an event, we will adapt it to another style

11:36.100 --> 11:38.100
But the concept is not finished yet

11:39.800 --> 11:46.800
We will use Affinity or Photoshop to drag the new event into the event

11:46.800 --> 11:50.100
It's a waste of time

11:50.100 --> 11:52.100
We are lazy

11:52.100 --> 11:59.100
So we have another repository called Banner

11:59.100 --> 12:00.100
The concept is simple

12:00.100 --> 12:03.100
We run the web as a service kit

12:03.100 --> 12:06.100
And when we trigger the event today

12:06.100 --> 12:06.800
The puppeteer will go in and find the event

12:06.800 --> 12:07.800
And the puppeteer will go in and find the event

12:07.800 --> 12:08.800
And the puppeteer will go in and find the event

12:08.800 --> 12:09.800
And the puppeteer will go in and find the event

12:09.800 --> 12:11.800
And it will then go hosting an event

12:11.800 --> 12:13.800
And it will be a traffic capture

12:13.800 --> 12:16.800
The website profile will be captured

12:16.800 --> 12:19.800
You will have to upload the picture to the YouTube apps

12:20.300 --> 12:24.800
And this action will keep running consistency

12:25.600 --> 12:29.500
This is an example of how we can use our device

12:29.500 --> 12:32.500
I will show you a little video

12:34.300 --> 12:35.000
OK

12:35.300 --> 12:36.800
So, this one

12:36.800 --> 12:38.800
These are some videos

12:38.800 --> 12:45.800
I will create a new thumbnail for the event.

12:45.800 --> 12:50.800
I will use the crop tool to align the grid.

12:50.800 --> 12:55.800
I want to get a header.

12:55.800 --> 13:01.800
I will detach this one.

13:01.800 --> 13:08.800
I will use the full demo.

13:08.800 --> 13:13.800
Did I remove the delete button?

13:13.800 --> 13:18.800
Never mind.

13:18.800 --> 13:22.800
I will not create a new one.

13:22.800 --> 13:25.800
But I will show you how to edit the thumbnail.

13:25.800 --> 13:28.800
For example, the slide project showdown.

13:28.800 --> 13:30.800
I will change it to a new one.

13:30.800 --> 13:33.800
It will be a code golf party.

13:33.800 --> 13:35.800
If we have a lot of videos,

13:35.800 --> 13:40.800
we can see that when we edit the video or the component,

13:40.800 --> 13:42.800
it will take effect everywhere.

13:42.800 --> 13:50.800
What I have to do is just export the frame to the frame.

13:50.800 --> 13:55.800
Then, I will get the thumbnail that is ready to be published.

13:55.800 --> 13:57.800
When I get a file like this,

13:57.800 --> 14:00.800
for example, the video report,

14:00.800 --> 14:07.800
what I can do is just go to the video report.

14:07.800 --> 14:16.800
When I want to update the thumbnail for a new session,

14:16.800 --> 14:20.800
I will just drag and drop the jpeg file into the video report.

14:20.800 --> 14:22.800
Then, I will push it up again.

14:22.800 --> 14:24.800
I will click on the action trigger for 1 minute.

14:24.800 --> 14:26.800
Then, I will click on the take change button on YouTube.

14:26.800 --> 14:28.800
Something like this.

14:28.800 --> 14:31.800
Let's go back.

14:35.800 --> 14:39.800
This is the process of making a short video.

14:39.800 --> 14:42.800
Now, we will be in the second part.

14:42.800 --> 14:48.800
We will manage the content in the wiki engine of Creators Garden.

14:48.800 --> 14:53.800
I will invite P'Tai to explain this session.

14:53.800 --> 14:55.800
Please.

14:55.800 --> 14:57.800
Thank you, Wigpy.

14:57.800 --> 15:02.800
Before I start, I would like to give a big hand to Wigpy.

15:02.800 --> 15:06.800
Because the content in the channel for the past 2-3 months,

15:06.800 --> 15:08.800
Wigpy has managed it all.

15:08.800 --> 15:10.800
Almost everything.

15:10.800 --> 15:12.800
I have set the system,

15:12.800 --> 15:14.800
made the figma,

15:14.800 --> 15:18.800
and Wigpy has done a pretty tough job.

15:18.800 --> 15:20.800
He always cuts the clip out,

15:20.800 --> 15:21.800
checks the sound,

15:21.800 --> 15:23.800
whether the sound is okay or not,

15:23.800 --> 15:25.800
uploads it to YouTube,

15:25.800 --> 15:26.800
makes the thumbnail, etc.

15:26.800 --> 15:28.800
Although we have automation,

15:28.800 --> 15:31.800
we have to admit that these works are very tough.

15:31.800 --> 15:34.800
Our channel will not grow this much without Wigpy.

15:34.800 --> 15:36.800
Thank you, Wigpy.

15:36.800 --> 15:40.800
And who hasn't subscribed to the Creators Garden channel,

15:40.800 --> 15:42.800
please subscribe.

15:42.800 --> 15:48.800
We want our content to have more viewers.

15:48.800 --> 15:53.800
Now, we have more than 200 people.

15:53.800 --> 15:55.800
400, right?

15:55.800 --> 15:56.800
Yes.

15:56.800 --> 15:58.800
This is the main thing.

15:58.800 --> 16:00.800
One more thing.

16:00.800 --> 16:04.800
In addition to running events and live work,

16:04.800 --> 16:09.800
we also have partners and organizers.

16:09.800 --> 16:12.800
Like Microsoft this time, Spark Tech, right?

16:13.800 --> 16:16.800
We are here and help live.

16:16.800 --> 16:18.800
We also grow the channel.

16:18.800 --> 16:22.800
So we hope it will be useful.

16:22.800 --> 16:23.800
This time,

16:23.800 --> 16:33.240
The last part is about the website Creators Garden that we have.

16:33.240 --> 16:36.980
This is the Creators Garden website, creatorsgarden.org.

16:36.980 --> 16:39.080
Let's take a look at the features first.

16:39.080 --> 16:43.100
There will be a cute page that contains events.

16:43.100 --> 16:46.300
And there is something called Wiki.

16:46.300 --> 16:49.200
Wiki is like a source of knowledge for us.

16:49.200 --> 16:56.700
Anything that is public knowledge, we will try to put it here.

16:56.700 --> 17:01.360
For example, about the setup and streaming.

17:01.360 --> 17:04.260
Previously, I and Liffy helped each other.

17:04.260 --> 17:12.040
But now we are taking the knowledge to many people to help each other stream.

17:12.040 --> 17:18.240
Liffy wrote in Wiki how to prepare OBS setup.

17:18.240 --> 17:19.200
These are in Wiki.

17:19.200 --> 17:23.760
The Wiki system is the main point of this talk.

17:23.760 --> 17:29.400
Because we wrote the custom Wiki system for the website Creators Garden to use.

17:29.400 --> 17:34.000
The question is, there are actually a lot of these things.

17:34.000 --> 17:36.100
Why do we have to write it ourselves?

17:36.100 --> 17:43.900
Before we get to this point, we have tried many solutions.

17:43.900 --> 17:48.240
We will go from the old solution to the most modern solution.

17:49.200 --> 17:54.200
The first one is the classic software.

17:54.200 --> 17:58.200
For example, MediaWiki, DokuWiki, PMWiki.

17:58.200 --> 18:02.700
These programs are easy to fix.

18:02.700 --> 18:04.700
This is the point that I really like.

18:04.700 --> 18:09.700
If we want to fix any page, we can press the edit button, type and save.

18:09.700 --> 18:13.760
There is something called the Wiki way.

18:13.760 --> 18:17.200
They say that the wiki's mind or the line of the wiki's mind.

18:17.200 --> 18:17.800
Or what is it called?

18:17.800 --> 18:18.200
The wiki's mind.

18:18.200 --> 18:18.500
The wiki's mind.

18:18.500 --> 18:18.800
The wiki's mind.

18:18.800 --> 18:19.300
The wiki's mind ?

18:19.300 --> 18:19.800
The wiki's mind.

18:19.800 --> 18:20.300
The wiki's mind.

18:20.300 --> 18:20.400
The wiki's mind.

18:20.400 --> 18:20.600
The wiki's mind?

18:20.600 --> 18:20.900
The wiki's mind?

18:20.900 --> 18:21.300
The wiki's mind.

18:21.300 --> 18:21.600
The wiki's mind?

18:21.600 --> 18:21.900
The wiki's mind?

18:21.900 --> 18:22.100
The wiki's mind?

18:22.100 --> 18:22.200
The wiki's mind?

18:22.200 --> 18:22.500
The wiki's mind,?

18:22.500 --> 18:22.700
The wiki's mind?

18:22.700 --> 18:23.100
The wiki's mind?

18:23.100 --> 18:23.400
The wiki's mind ?

18:23.400 --> 18:23.800
The wiki's mind ?

18:23.800 --> 18:24.100
The wiki's mind ?

18:24.100 --> 18:24.500
The wiki's mind ?

18:24.500 --> 18:24.800
The wiki's mind ?

18:24.800 --> 18:26.300
The wiki's mind ?

18:26.300 --> 18:28.600
The wiki's mind ?

18:28.600 --> 18:28.900
The wiki's mind ?

18:28.900 --> 18:29.300
The wiki's mind ?

18:29.300 --> 18:29.600
The wiki's mind ?

18:29.600 --> 18:29.700
The wiki's mind ?

18:29.700 --> 18:30.040
The wiki's mind ?

18:30.040 --> 18:30.300
The wiki's mind ?

18:30.300 --> 18:35.300
It will be changed frequently.

18:35.300 --> 18:39.300
The Wikisoftware program is very easy to edit.

18:39.300 --> 18:44.300
The second thing I like is that the wikisoftware is a plaintext format.

18:44.300 --> 18:46.300
How is plaintext good?

18:46.300 --> 18:50.300
When I want to edit, I can copy these messages to the VSCode

18:50.300 --> 18:52.300
and use the text editor that I like.

18:52.300 --> 18:55.300
After that, copy and paste it back in and press save.

18:55.300 --> 18:58.300
One of the things I like is plaintext.

18:58.300 --> 19:02.300
Another thing is that the system is quite flexible.

19:02.300 --> 19:06.300
For example, this wiki is called TVTropes.

19:06.300 --> 19:10.300
It uses the PM wiki to make it into its own web.

19:10.300 --> 19:12.300
I don't know what features it has.

19:12.300 --> 19:16.300
It's a wiki that I really like.

19:16.300 --> 19:19.300
The extension of MediaWiki itself is 100.

19:19.300 --> 19:23.300
We can install it to customize our wiki.

19:23.300 --> 19:27.300
This is what I like about wiki programs.

19:27.300 --> 19:28.300
But the thing that I like about it is that

19:28.300 --> 19:30.300
it has a pain point.

19:30.300 --> 19:34.300
First, most of these programs are written in PHP.

19:34.300 --> 19:40.300
So when we deploy, we have to rent a server and set up a database.

19:40.300 --> 19:43.300
It's not really a container.

19:43.300 --> 19:47.300
The text stack is not really cloud-native.

19:47.300 --> 19:51.300
Another thing is that I don't really like its syntax.

19:51.300 --> 19:53.300
It's not Markdown.

19:53.300 --> 19:57.300
For MediaWiki, if we want to make it thick,

19:57.300 --> 19:59.300
we have to write three single quotes.

19:59.300 --> 20:02.300
If you write Markdown, you might be confused.

20:02.300 --> 20:05.300
When you write wiki, you have to change the syntax.

20:05.300 --> 20:07.300
You might not like it.

20:07.300 --> 20:11.300
Another thing is that these wiki come in a package.

20:11.300 --> 20:14.300
So it will come with a theme and so on.

20:14.300 --> 20:18.300
It will be written as a PHP template.

20:18.300 --> 20:21.300
And then use jQuery, use regular CSS.

20:21.300 --> 20:24.300
So if we want to customize with Tailwind or React,

20:24.300 --> 20:26.300
it's quite difficult to integrate.

20:26.300 --> 20:33.300
So we didn't choose to use a successful wiki software.

20:33.300 --> 20:37.300
The second option is the static size generator.

20:37.300 --> 20:39.300
It just came out.

20:39.300 --> 20:42.300
It's been around for about 10 years.

20:42.300 --> 20:47.300
There will be Jackal, Eleventy, Hugo, Weedplace, etc.

20:47.300 --> 20:50.300
What I like is that it's plain text, Markdown.

20:50.300 --> 20:52.300
And the content is in the grid.

20:52.300 --> 20:54.300
Easy to fix.

20:54.300 --> 20:58.300
And when it's a static file, we can upload it to hosting.

20:58.300 --> 21:01.300
No need to take care of the server.

21:01.300 --> 21:05.300
There will be GitHub page that can host these static sizes.

21:05.300 --> 21:09.300
Including others such as Netlify, Vercel, Cloudflare, Pages, etc.

21:09.300 --> 21:10.300
It's all full.

21:10.300 --> 21:16.300
But the downside I found when making a web with static size generator is

21:16.300 --> 21:19.300
It's quite difficult to contribute.

21:19.300 --> 21:23.300
Because the traditional wiki, we press edit, fix, save.

21:23.300 --> 21:24.300
Finish.

21:24.300 --> 21:26.300
See the result immediately.

21:26.300 --> 21:28.300
But when it comes to static size generator,

21:28.300 --> 21:34.300
I have to fork, repo, fix, run dev server, check, commit.

21:34.300 --> 21:36.300
Push up, open PR.

21:36.300 --> 21:39.300
Wait for people to review PR and it will be uploaded on the web.

21:39.300 --> 21:44.300
Like this one, I try to contribute to the documentation of Next.js.

21:44.300 --> 21:48.300
You will see that I fixed only 2 buttons.

21:48.300 --> 21:50.300
But I have to explain what I fixed.

21:50.300 --> 21:52.300
Almost 10 buttons.

21:52.300 --> 21:54.300
Like this.

21:54.300 --> 21:58.300
It makes it quite difficult to fix.

21:58.300 --> 22:02.300
It's different from the wiki way that says it's easy to fix.

22:02.300 --> 22:04.300
Easy to revert.

22:04.300 --> 22:11.300
And when fixing, I have to fork, repo, run dev server.

22:11.300 --> 22:13.300
It's not very convenient.

22:13.300 --> 22:16.300
And when I'm done, I haven't seen the result yet.

22:16.300 --> 22:19.300
I have to wait for the web to rebuild and wait for it to redeploy.

22:19.300 --> 22:21.300
It will get new content.

22:21.300 --> 22:27.300
So I decided not to use static size generator.

22:27.300 --> 22:35.300
But when I'm in this era, there's a tool that has been booming in the past 4-5 years.

22:35.300 --> 22:37.300
It's Notion.

22:37.300 --> 22:41.300
Actually, we've been using Notion a lot since 2019.

22:41.300 --> 22:45.300
We use Notion to store knowledge for all kinds of work.

22:45.300 --> 22:47.300
I really like Notion.

22:47.300 --> 22:49.300
When we fix many people,

22:49.300 --> 22:52.300
UX is very good.

22:52.300 --> 22:56.300
And now, many people use Notion almost all.

22:56.300 --> 22:59.300
But what I still feel is disturbing is that

22:59.300 --> 23:06.300
First, sometimes I want to put in bar charts, speech bubbles, or widgets that are not in Notion.

23:06.300 --> 23:12.300
We can't fully control the website's appearance that much.

23:12.300 --> 23:15.300
Second, I hate Notion's size bar.

23:15.300 --> 23:17.300
Because I try to...

23:17.300 --> 23:23.300
I try to organize the content in Notion.

23:23.300 --> 23:27.300
No matter how much I try to organize, it's still a mess.

23:27.300 --> 23:29.300
So I don't like the size bar.

23:29.300 --> 23:33.300
I prefer to have the bar charts and links.

23:33.300 --> 23:36.300
Another thing is that the content is in its own form.

23:36.300 --> 23:38.300
It's not plain text.

23:38.300 --> 23:41.300
I just copied it, fixed it in VS Code, and pasted it back.

23:41.300 --> 23:44.300
And if many people use it and have a lot of information,

23:44.300 --> 23:46.300
it may be expensive.

23:46.300 --> 23:51.300
So I tried to create a wiki engine myself.

23:51.300 --> 23:53.300
This wiki engine is called Content Skarten.

23:53.300 --> 23:55.300
I'll show you the features.

23:55.300 --> 23:59.300
It's open source, headless, modern, and cloud-native.

23:59.300 --> 24:01.300
It's a wiki engine.

24:01.300 --> 24:03.300
The main thing is to use Markdown syntax.

24:03.300 --> 24:05.300
When you see this, it's Markdown.

24:05.300 --> 24:07.300
If you want to add something, just add a flower.

24:07.300 --> 24:09.300
No need to remember the new syntax.

24:09.300 --> 24:12.300
And the content is stored in Git.

24:12.300 --> 24:14.300
So if you go to Creator Skarten or wiki,

24:14.300 --> 24:17.300
you'll see all the information.

24:17.300 --> 24:19.300
It's a Markdown file.

24:19.300 --> 24:21.300
And when it's in Git,

24:21.300 --> 24:24.300
the good thing is that we can fix it directly on the web.

24:24.300 --> 24:26.300
We have a UI for fixing it on the web.

24:26.300 --> 24:30.300
But we'll clone the repo to fix it in our own editor.

24:30.300 --> 24:32.300
Or currently,

24:32.300 --> 24:35.300
there's a web called github.dev

24:35.300 --> 24:37.300
that is a VS Code in the browser.

24:37.300 --> 24:41.300
It allows us to fix content

24:41.300 --> 24:44.300
by using the VS Code editor,

24:44.300 --> 24:45.300
but it's in the web.

24:45.300 --> 24:47.300
We've integrated this already.

24:47.300 --> 24:51.300
If we go to the Creator Skarten wiki

24:51.300 --> 24:53.300
and press the dot button,

24:53.300 --> 24:56.300
it'll take us to github.dev.

24:56.300 --> 25:01.300
Or when we use VS Code to fix what we get,

25:01.300 --> 25:03.300
when we write, we won't be writing alone

25:03.300 --> 25:06.300
because we have GitHub Code Pilot to help us write.

25:06.300 --> 25:10.300
And if you want to make large scale changes,

25:10.300 --> 25:11.300
for example,

25:11.300 --> 25:14.300
I want to fix many files at once,

25:14.300 --> 25:17.300
I don't have to write scripts to shoot APIs

25:17.300 --> 25:20.300
to API Notion or API this and that.

25:20.300 --> 25:21.300
I can just import the repo,

25:21.300 --> 25:23.300
write scripts, fix files,

25:23.300 --> 25:26.300
and commit push back to wiki.

25:28.300 --> 25:31.300
And the next feature is that it's very tight

25:31.300 --> 25:33.300
integrated with GitHub.

25:33.300 --> 25:37.300
When we fix a page in the Content Skarten,

25:37.300 --> 25:39.300
what happens is that it shoots APIs

25:39.300 --> 25:44.300
to the GitHub API to fix that file directly on GitHub.

25:44.300 --> 25:47.300
We use GitHub as a source of truth.

25:47.300 --> 25:50.300
And when the information is on GitHub,

25:50.300 --> 25:53.300
it allows us to use GitHub's various features,

25:53.300 --> 25:55.300
such as webhooks.

25:55.300 --> 25:58.300
When someone fixes a page,

25:58.300 --> 26:01.300
I set up a webhook to shoot it into Discord.

26:01.300 --> 26:03.300
So when someone fixes it,

26:03.300 --> 26:04.300
they know immediately.

26:04.300 --> 26:05.300
You don't have to write a code

26:05.300 --> 26:07.300
because it's a feature that GitHub has for you.

26:07.300 --> 26:09.300
You don't have to implement it yourself.

26:09.300 --> 26:15.300
And with the fact that Git has a history,

26:15.300 --> 26:17.300
we don't have to implement features

26:17.300 --> 26:20.300
that look at what this page is fixed.

26:20.300 --> 26:21.300
When you press history,

26:21.300 --> 26:23.300
it runs into GitHub.

26:24.300 --> 26:27.300
And when it's a web that we do it ourselves,

26:27.300 --> 26:29.300
we can do syntax,

26:29.300 --> 26:31.300
do various components of ourselves.

26:31.300 --> 26:34.300
For example, sometimes we want to have it.

26:34.300 --> 26:38.300
We want to discuss some parts of the content,

26:38.300 --> 26:41.300
but we're not ready to write a real text.

26:41.300 --> 26:43.300
And then create a speech bubble like this.

26:43.300 --> 26:48.300
Let people who are editors talk to each other.

26:48.300 --> 26:53.300
Or sometimes we want to visualize the feedback of the work.

26:53.300 --> 26:56.300
We do it like this.

26:56.300 --> 27:01.300
Or this page will be the page that includes all our events.

27:01.300 --> 27:05.300
We will have links related to each event.

27:05.300 --> 27:07.300
You will see that it is a fairly advanced table.

27:07.300 --> 27:10.300
But the code behind it is just this.

27:10.300 --> 27:13.300
It can render templates.

27:13.300 --> 27:17.300
And the template can query information from other pages

27:17.300 --> 27:20.300
to generate a table.

27:20.300 --> 27:23.300
This is using the language called Liquid.

27:23.300 --> 27:28.300
So that we don't have to maintain this table.

27:28.300 --> 27:30.300
When we create a new page,

27:30.300 --> 27:33.300
this table will update accordingly.

27:33.300 --> 27:35.300
This is from GitHub.

27:35.300 --> 27:40.300
This is from the feature called Front Matter.

27:40.300 --> 27:47.300
We can put a data structure that is YAML in each page.

27:47.300 --> 27:51.300
And those information will be put into the database,

27:51.300 --> 27:53.300
which we can query later.

27:53.300 --> 27:55.300
For example, this event page,

27:55.300 --> 27:57.300
we don't have to keep updating it all the time.

27:57.300 --> 28:00.300
It's just going to be queried from the database.

28:00.300 --> 28:04.300
So this feature allows us to implement advanced features.

28:04.300 --> 28:09.300
For example, we can keep the website settings in the wiki.

28:09.300 --> 28:14.300
And the feature flags are kept in the wiki.

28:14.300 --> 28:16.300
Or even the inventory,

28:16.300 --> 28:18.300
the tools that we track,

28:18.300 --> 28:21.300
whether there is any tool in the Creator's Garden.

28:21.300 --> 28:24.300
We have this page to track what tools we have.

28:24.300 --> 28:26.300
But we don't write,

28:26.300 --> 28:30.300
we don't keep the information as a markdown.

28:30.300 --> 28:32.300
We keep it as YAML like this.

28:32.300 --> 28:36.300
And then we write it as a script,

28:36.300 --> 28:41.300
as a template to generate a beautiful chart again.

28:41.300 --> 28:45.300
Therefore, the advantage of keeping everything as YAML is that

28:45.300 --> 28:47.300
it is machine readable.

28:47.300 --> 28:50.300
We can write a script or write a tool

28:50.300 --> 28:53.300
to update this information.

28:53.300 --> 28:54.300
That's it.

28:54.300 --> 28:56.300
I like that it is open data.

28:56.300 --> 28:59.300
Finally, it is headless.

28:59.300 --> 29:01.300
The web page that you see is not part of the content.

29:01.300 --> 29:03.300
It is part of the content garden.

29:03.300 --> 29:05.300
Because the content garden has only APIs.

29:05.300 --> 29:07.300
There are APIs like this.

29:07.300 --> 29:10.300
For example, we shoot the API content garden search.

29:10.300 --> 29:13.300
Send match event location as cleft words.

29:13.300 --> 29:15.300
When we shoot this API,

29:15.300 --> 29:17.300
it will find the entire event.

29:17.300 --> 29:22.300
It will find the entire page that has event.location as cleft words.

29:22.300 --> 29:25.300
That is, we put the information into the wiki.

29:25.300 --> 29:27.300
And we ask the wiki question.

29:27.300 --> 29:29.300
It will answer back.

29:29.300 --> 29:30.300
Okay.

29:30.300 --> 29:34.300
Next, this is the basic feature of this system.

29:34.300 --> 29:36.300
Let's look at the tech stack.

29:36.300 --> 29:40.300
The main thing is that the website is a repo.

29:40.300 --> 29:42.300
Written with Astro.

29:42.300 --> 29:46.300
If you go to BKKJS event first,

29:46.300 --> 29:48.300
Liffy will recommend Astro.

29:48.300 --> 29:49.300
Ah, call meetup.

29:49.300 --> 29:50.300
Yes.

29:50.300 --> 29:51.300
If you want to know about Astro,

29:51.300 --> 29:55.300
you can watch the talk back on YouTube channel.

29:55.300 --> 29:58.300
And the backend is the content garden.

29:58.300 --> 30:01.300
The content garden will be at this repo.

30:01.300 --> 30:04.300
Ah, the work is that it will talk to GitHub API

30:04.300 --> 30:08.300
to extract data from the repository that we consider to be a source of truth.

30:08.300 --> 30:16.300
But, ah, remember the example that we found all the events that can be arranged at cleft words, right?

30:16.300 --> 30:20.300
Ah, GitHub API does not have an API for this kind of query.

30:20.300 --> 30:25.300
We have to, so we have to keep another database as a cache, an index.

30:25.300 --> 30:27.300
So, ah, the source of truth will be this.

30:27.300 --> 30:30.300
But the data will flow to MongoDB.

30:30.300 --> 30:36.300
And we will have to arrange the data format so that we can query the data that is in each file.

30:36.300 --> 30:40.300
Ah, so this is the content garden.

30:40.300 --> 30:42.300
Let's come to the conclusion.

30:42.300 --> 30:49.300
Ah, the takeaway for this talk is that I feel that GitHub ecosystem of GitHub

30:49.300 --> 30:55.300
It allows us to build a custom wiki system as quickly as possible.

30:55.300 --> 30:56.300
It is.

30:56.300 --> 31:02.300
I think that if we do not have, if we do not have webhook systems or GitHub API

31:02.300 --> 31:08.300
that have API that stores history or various tools like GitHub.dev, something like this.

31:08.300 --> 31:11.300
Or even GitHub co-pilot that helps me write code.

31:11.300 --> 31:15.300
Building a system like this, it should take a lot longer than this.

31:15.300 --> 31:19.300
Well, I have to say that the content garden is very bare bones.

31:19.300 --> 31:21.300
Even just deleting the page, it still can't do it.

31:21.300 --> 31:24.300
But I don't have to implement because we don't delete the page often.

31:24.300 --> 31:28.300
But as I want to delete the page, I click into the repo and delete the file.

31:28.300 --> 31:30.300
Ah, don't have to implement it yourself.

31:30.300 --> 31:36.300
That is, we stand on top of the shoulder of giants.

31:36.300 --> 31:41.300
The next thing is the data that we keep as plain text and keep it in the grid.

31:41.300 --> 31:44.300
It allows us to build things.

31:44.300 --> 31:46.300
Add, add, add.

31:46.300 --> 31:50.300
Without using any API, like this.

31:50.300 --> 31:53.300
One idea that I used to think about is that I want to try to see that.

31:53.300 --> 31:55.300
Each page is connected.

31:55.300 --> 31:57.300
I did this with my own website.

31:57.300 --> 32:05.300
But it might be cool if we can see that each page is connected.

32:05.300 --> 32:08.300
And it becomes what is called a knowledge graph.

32:08.300 --> 32:12.300
Or this tool is garden.org.

32:12.300 --> 32:16.300
It is a link shortener that creators garden use.

32:16.300 --> 32:21.300
Ah, in the past, we might have to give access to bitly or.

32:21.300 --> 32:22.300
Or like.

32:22.300 --> 32:23.300
Or like.

32:23.300 --> 32:26.300
The service of some of the angels that might be expensive.

32:26.300 --> 32:29.300
Ah, but when we have a content garden.

32:29.300 --> 32:32.300
We put all the links in the wiki.

32:32.300 --> 32:35.300
And then we write a program for garden.org.

32:35.300 --> 32:38.300
Pull the information from the front matter here.

32:38.300 --> 32:40.300
And then manage the redirect.

32:40.300 --> 32:44.300
Well, I think that when the data is open.

32:44.300 --> 32:47.300
We can easily do something with it.

32:47.300 --> 32:49.300
Or like on YouTube channel.

32:49.300 --> 32:50.300
What Liffy showed to see.

32:50.300 --> 32:52.300
That the channel banner.

32:52.300 --> 32:54.300
It is the logo of the event.

32:54.300 --> 32:56.300
Different that we set up.

32:56.300 --> 32:59.300
This one also draws information from wiki as well.

32:59.300 --> 33:02.300
But I have to say that the last one.

33:02.300 --> 33:04.300
This tool is not a silver bullet.

33:04.300 --> 33:06.300
Many people complain as well.

33:06.300 --> 33:08.300
I don't like it to be plain text.

33:08.300 --> 33:10.300
I want to give like editing experience.

33:10.300 --> 33:11.300
It's like notion.

33:11.300 --> 33:12.300
Something like this.

33:12.300 --> 33:13.300
Right?

33:13.300 --> 33:14.300
Um.

33:14.300 --> 33:16.300
Or sometimes.

33:16.300 --> 33:20.300
Ah, there are some content that may not be public.

33:20.300 --> 33:21.300
Ah, or.

33:21.300 --> 33:24.300
It may not be practical to be public.

33:24.300 --> 33:26.300
Ah, I suggest that.

33:26.300 --> 33:27.300
Um.

33:27.300 --> 33:30.300
Let's use the right tool for the right job.

33:30.300 --> 33:32.300
That is, if you want to meet.

33:32.300 --> 33:34.300
Ah, you can use notion.

33:34.300 --> 33:35.300
Or use Google Doc.

33:35.300 --> 33:36.300
If you want to keep it as a schedule.

33:36.300 --> 33:37.300
Ah, Google Sheet.

33:37.300 --> 33:38.300
If you want to design, Figma.

33:38.300 --> 33:41.300
Use the right tool for the right job.

33:41.300 --> 33:44.300
But one thing that I would encourage.

33:44.300 --> 33:46.300
Is to try to make everything.

33:46.300 --> 33:47.300
Reachable.

33:47.300 --> 33:48.300
Reachable from wiki.

33:48.300 --> 33:49.300
Meaning.

33:49.300 --> 33:50.300
Reachable in this place.

33:50.300 --> 33:51.300
Meaning that.

33:51.300 --> 33:52.300
If we go to the wiki.

33:52.300 --> 33:53.300
It should have a route from.

33:53.300 --> 33:54.300
From the web.

33:54.300 --> 33:55.300
Ah.

33:55.300 --> 33:56.300
Go to.

33:56.300 --> 33:57.300
Go to the information set.

33:57.300 --> 33:58.300
For example.

33:58.300 --> 33:59.300
If I want to.

33:59.300 --> 34:00.300
Go to see that.

34:00.300 --> 34:01.300
When we organized the stupid hackathon.

34:01.300 --> 34:02.300
The second time.

34:02.300 --> 34:03.300
Which.

34:03.300 --> 34:04.300
That was in 2018.

34:04.300 --> 34:05.300
About 7 years ago.

34:05.300 --> 34:06.300
Ah.

34:06.300 --> 34:07.300
Proposal.

34:07.300 --> 34:08.300
What do we write?

34:08.300 --> 34:09.300
Well.

34:09.300 --> 34:10.300
Ah.

34:10.300 --> 34:11.300
Open the web page.

34:11.300 --> 34:12.300
Go to wiki.

34:12.300 --> 34:13.300
And then go to the list of events.

34:13.300 --> 34:14.300
And then.

34:14.300 --> 34:15.300
Go to the stupid hackathon Thailand.

34:15.300 --> 34:16.300
Ah.

34:16.300 --> 34:17.300
Come to.

34:17.300 --> 34:18.300
The page that is a coverage.

34:18.300 --> 34:19.300
And then.

34:19.300 --> 34:20.300
There will be a list of documents.

34:20.300 --> 34:21.300
We will have information for sponsors.

34:21.300 --> 34:22.300
At that time.

34:22.300 --> 34:23.300
We.

34:23.300 --> 34:24.300
At that time.

34:24.300 --> 34:25.300
We didn't use notion.

34:25.300 --> 34:26.300
At that time.

34:26.300 --> 34:27.300
We keep it in the drop box paper.

34:27.300 --> 34:28.300
Ah.

34:28.300 --> 34:29.300
I don't know who.

34:29.300 --> 34:30.300
Have you ever used it?

34:30.300 --> 34:31.300
Drop box paper.

34:31.300 --> 34:32.300
Ah.

34:32.300 --> 34:33.300
It may come before notion.

34:33.300 --> 34:34.300
Ah.

34:34.300 --> 34:35.300
But.

34:35.300 --> 34:36.300
In conclusion.

34:36.300 --> 34:37.300
No matter where the information is.

34:37.300 --> 34:38.300
It.

34:38.300 --> 34:39.300
At least.

34:39.300 --> 34:40.300
It is reachable.

34:40.300 --> 34:41.300
From.

34:41.300 --> 34:42.300
From.

34:42.300 --> 34:43.300
From our main face.

34:43.300 --> 34:44.300
Will make.

34:44.300 --> 34:45.300
It will make us.

34:45.300 --> 34:46.300
Ah.

34:46.300 --> 34:47.300
Like.

34:47.300 --> 34:48.300
Our knowledge.

34:48.300 --> 34:49.300
Will not disappear.

34:49.300 --> 34:50.300
If it is still.

34:50.300 --> 34:51.300
Reachable.

34:51.300 --> 34:52.300
Ah.

34:52.300 --> 34:53.300
Ah.

34:53.300 --> 34:54.300
Then.

34:54.300 --> 34:55.300
This is.

34:55.300 --> 34:56.300
The conclusion.

34:56.300 --> 34:57.300
That.

34:57.300 --> 34:58.300
I want to conclude.

34:58.300 --> 34:59.300
In this talk.

34:59.300 --> 35:00.300
Well.

35:00.300 --> 35:01.300
This will be.

35:01.300 --> 35:02.300
A link.

35:02.300 --> 35:03.300
To report.

35:03.300 --> 35:04.300
But.

35:04.300 --> 35:05.300
You don't have to remember.

35:05.300 --> 35:06.300
Go to.

35:06.300 --> 35:07.300
Wiki.

35:07.300 --> 35:08.300
And then.

35:08.300 --> 35:09.300
Go to.

35:09.300 --> 35:10.300
Textstack.

35:10.300 --> 35:11.300
Well.

35:11.300 --> 35:12.300
Ah.

35:12.300 --> 35:13.300
For.

35:13.300 --> 35:14.300
My session.

35:14.300 --> 35:15.300
There will be only this.

35:15.300 --> 35:16.300
Well.

35:16.300 --> 35:17.300
Ah.

35:17.300 --> 35:18.300
Thank you.

35:18.300 --> 35:19.300
Everyone.

35:19.300 --> 35:20.300
For.

35:20.300 --> 35:21.300
Answer.

35:21.300 --> 35:22.300
A lot.

35:22.300 --> 35:23.300
Yes.

35:23.300 --> 35:24.300
I.

35:24.300 --> 35:25.300
Where?

35:25.300 --> 35:26.300
I.

35:26.300 --> 35:27.300
And take.

35:27.300 --> 35:28.300
Yes I will.

35:28.300 --> 35:29.300
Uh.

35:29.300 --> 35:30.300
Ask.

35:30.300 --> 35:31.300
What.

35:31.300 --> 35:32.300
What we see.

35:32.300 --> 35:33.300
As.

35:33.300 --> 35:34.300
A project.

35:34.300 --> 35:35.300
Do.

35:35.300 --> 35:36.300
Is.

35:36.300 --> 35:37.300
Right?

35:37.300 --> 35:38.300
Now.

35:38.300 --> 35:39.300
I want.

35:39.300 --> 35:40.300
What about.

35:40.300 --> 35:41.300
Evaluation.

35:41.300 --> 35:42.300
What.

35:42.300 --> 35:43.300
We.

35:43.300 --> 35:44.300
Evaluation.

35:44.300 --> 35:45.300
Form.

35:45.300 --> 35:46.300
From.

35:46.300 --> 35:47.300
Project.

35:47.300 --> 35:48.300
How.

35:48.300 --> 35:50.300
I'm sorry.

35:50.300 --> 35:52.300
Oh, like...

35:54.300 --> 35:59.300
Okay, I mean, after we have organized the project, right?

35:59.300 --> 36:03.300
There will be a feedback form that this part needs to be adjusted like this.

36:03.300 --> 36:07.300
We have a summary of how to evaluate the data.

36:07.300 --> 36:11.300
How can we improve the future management?

36:11.300 --> 36:14.300
Can we do it like Tata here?

36:14.300 --> 36:16.300
How can we develop the team to do this?

36:16.300 --> 36:18.300
Okay.

36:18.300 --> 36:20.300
Oh, thank you very much, Lekphi.

36:20.300 --> 36:22.300
Okay, thank you for the question.

36:22.300 --> 36:25.300
This is the feedback of the 7th Stupid Hackathon.

36:25.300 --> 36:27.300
The latest project that we organized.

36:27.300 --> 36:30.300
After the project is finished, we will shoot a Google Form and ask questions.

36:30.300 --> 36:32.300
Usually, we will ask 5 questions.

36:32.300 --> 36:33.300
1. What do you like?

36:33.300 --> 36:35.300
2. What should be improved?

36:35.300 --> 36:37.300
3. What do you want us to try?

36:37.300 --> 36:40.300
And then, the fourth question is to give a score of 1-10.

36:40.300 --> 36:43.300
And then, the fifth question is to say that you want to write something in it.

36:43.300 --> 36:44.300
Just write it.

36:44.300 --> 36:46.300
Then, I will take the question.

36:46.300 --> 36:49.300
I will take the question and write it in the wiki.

36:49.300 --> 36:56.300
Then, the next generation of staff will be able to see the event list to see the feedback of the previous work.

36:56.300 --> 36:59.300
It will not disappear.

36:59.300 --> 37:00.300
Ah.

37:00.300 --> 37:01.300
Yes.

37:01.300 --> 37:04.300
For the 7th Stupid Hackathon,

37:04.300 --> 37:06.300
what is your favorite activity?

37:06.300 --> 37:08.300
Each person who answered will be listed.

37:08.300 --> 37:10.300
After that,

37:10.300 --> 37:12.300
the one who answered, we will post it to the GPT chat.

37:12.300 --> 37:14.300
The summary is...

37:14.300 --> 37:15.300
Ah.

37:15.300 --> 37:34.300
So, if you want to read our information or to see the summary of the chat GPT, including the points, how many points we will keep in this.

37:34.300 --> 37:40.300
And how many people answered, how much average, there will be a calculation automatically.

37:40.300 --> 37:48.300
Therefore, the team that organizes the next round can come in and see, including ideas for next year.

37:48.300 --> 37:58.300
If you want to know what ideas the people who organize the previous generation have, come in and see these.

37:58.300 --> 38:01.300
Come in and see the summary that we can talk about.

38:01.300 --> 38:07.300
And there will be, let me find it for a moment.

38:07.300 --> 38:13.300
Data, here it is.

38:13.300 --> 38:16.300
In addition, we will have to collect data of various STUPID events.

38:16.300 --> 38:27.300
We have arranged 7 rounds and we have a clip track that in each year, how many teams there are, how many tickets, presenters, how many people come to present the work, event rating, something like this.

38:27.300 --> 38:31.300
When you click on the event rating, it will take you to see the feedback.

38:31.300 --> 38:36.300
This is the way we collect feedback in various events.

38:36.300 --> 38:38.300
We don't want it to disappear.

38:38.300 --> 38:40.300
Answer the question.

38:40.300 --> 38:42.300
Ok.

38:45.300 --> 38:47.300
Any additional questions?

38:50.300 --> 38:51.300
Ok, that's about it.

38:51.300 --> 38:53.300
Thank you, P'Thy and Liffy.

38:57.300 --> 38:59.300
Very cool, P'Shank.

38:59.300 --> 39:02.300
Ok, let's set up first.

39:02.300 --> 39:04.300
How is it, P'Pup?

39:04.300 --> 39:05.300
See today.

39:05.300 --> 39:08.300
Oh, I just know that Bitbucket can do a lot of things.

39:08.300 --> 39:14.300
Oh, I still want to get a sticker of KritHub.

39:14.300 --> 39:16.300
Ok, I said it wrong.

39:16.300 --> 39:19.300
I just know that KritLab can do a lot of things.

39:19.300 --> 39:22.300
I wouldn't set up a post like this.
