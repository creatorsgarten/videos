  Maya Shavin, a senior software engineer at Microsoft and accessibility champion, explores the nuances of frontend component testing in this insightful talk. She delves into the importance of validating both the functionality and visual aspects of UI elements, emphasizing how these tests ensure a consistent user experience across different devices and browsers. The talk examines the roles of unit and end-to-end testing, specifically focusing on visual testing within these contexts. Using a practical example of a search component, Maya demonstrates how visual testing can be implemented using Vitest, a lightweight test runner, and Playwright, a browser-based end-to-end testing tool. She further explores the intriguing possibility of combining the strengths of both tools within Vitest's browser mode, offering a potentially streamlined approach to comprehensive component testing. Discover how to effectively test your Vue components for both behavior and appearance, ensuring a polished and accessible user interface.
