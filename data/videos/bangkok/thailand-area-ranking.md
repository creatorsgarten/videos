  Thailand Area Ranking is an OpenSource project that helps users find suitable areas in Thailand by analyzing various factors, such as public transportation, schools, cost of living, employment rates, cleanliness and others. The results are displayed as Heatmaps, with redder areas indicating a better match to your needs. Additionally, developers can utilize our library in PIPY for real estate applications, such as searching for houses near water sources or incorporating local price data.
